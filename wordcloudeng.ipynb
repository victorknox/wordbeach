meaning knowledge  is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe .', 'the earliest roots of science can be traced to ancient egypt and mesopotamia in around to bce .', 'their contributions to mathematics  astronomy  and medicine entered and shaped greek natural philosophy of classical antiquity  whereby formal attempts were made to provide explanations of events in the physical world based on natural causes.', 'after the fall of the western roman empire  knowledge of greek conceptions of the world deteriorated in western europe during the early centuries  to ce of the middle ages   but was preserved in the muslim world during the islamic golden age .', 'the recovery and assimilation of greek works and islamic inquiries into western europe from the to century revived  natural philosophy    which was later transformed by the scientific revolution that began in the century  as new ideas and discoveries departed from previous greek conceptions and traditions.', 'the scientific method soon played a greater role in knowledge creation and it was not until the century that many of the institutional and professional features of science began to take shape    along with the changing of natural philosophy to natural science.', 'modern science is typically divided into three major branches  that consist of the natural sciences e.g.', 'biology  chemistry  and physics  which study nature in the broadest sense the social sciences e.g.', 'economics  psychology  and sociology  which study individuals and societies   and the formal sciences e.g.', 'logic  mathematics  and theoretical computer science  which deal with symbols governed by rules.', 'there is disagreement    however on whether the formal sciences actually constitute a science as they do not rely on empirical evidence .', 'disciplines that use existing scientific knowledge for practical purposes such as engineering and medicine are described as applied sciences .', 'new knowledge in science is advanced by research from scientists who are motivated by curiosity about the world and a desire to solve problems.', 'contemporary scientific research is highly collaborative and is usually done by teams in academic and research institutions   government agencies  and companies .', 'the practical impact of their work has led to the emergence of science policies that seek to influence the scientific enterprise by prioritizing the development of commercial products  armaments  health care  public infrastructure  and environmental protection .', 'contents history of science science in a broad sense existed before the modern era and in many historical civilizations .', 'modern science is distinct in its approach and successful in its results  so it now defines what science is in the strictest sense of the term.', 'science in its original sense was a word for a type of knowledge  rather than a specialized word for the pursuit of such knowledge.', 'in particular it was the type of knowledge that people can communicate to each other and share.', 'for example knowledge about the working of natural things was gathered long before recorded history and led to the development of complex abstract thought .', 'this is shown by the construction of complex calendars  techniques for making poisonous plants edible public works at a national scale such as those which harnessed the floodplain of the yangtse with reservoirs   dams and dikes and buildings such as the pyramids.',

is an empirical method of acquiring knowledge that has characterized the development of science since at least the century.', 'it involves careful observation  applying rigorous skepticism about what is observed given that cognitive assumptions can distort how one interprets the observation .', 'it involves formulating hypotheses  via induction  based on such observations experimental and measurement-based testing of deductions drawn from the hypotheses and refinement or elimination of the hypotheses based on the experimental findings.', 'these are of the scientific method as distinguished from a definitive series of steps applicable to all scientific enterprises.', 'although procedures vary from one field of inquiry to another the underlying process is frequently the same from one field to another.', 'the process in the scientific method involves making conjectures hypotheses deriving predictions from them as logical consequences and then carrying out experiments or empirical observations based on those predictions.', 'a hypothesis is a conjecture based on knowledge obtained while seeking answers to the question.', 'the hypothesis might be very specific or it might be broad.', 'scientists then test hypotheses by conducting experiments or studies.', 'a scientific hypothesis must be falsifiable  implying that it is possible to identify a possible outcome of an experiment or observation that conflicts with predictions deduced from the hypothesis otherwise the hypothesis cannot be meaningfully tested.', 'the purpose of an experiment is to determine whether observations agree with or conflict with the predictions derived from a hypothesis.', 'experiments can take place anywhere from a garage to cern large hadron collider .', 'there are difficulties in a formulaic statement of method however.', 'though the scientific method is often presented as a fixed sequence of steps it represents rather a set of general principles.', 'not all steps take place in

al-haytham methodology reproducibility   johannes kepler c.s.', 'peirce  galileo galilei albert einstein  important debates in the history of science concern rationalism  especially as advocated by ren descartes  inductivism andor empiricism  as argued for by francis bacon  and rising to particular prominence with isaac newton and his followers and hypothetico-deductivism  which came to the fore in the early century.', 'the term scientific method emerged in the century when a significant institutional development of science was taking place and terminologies establishing clear boundaries between science and non-science such as scientist and pseudoscience appeared.', 'throughout the and  by which time baconianism was popular naturalists like william whewell john herschel john stuart mill engaged in debates over induction and facts and were focused on how to generate knowledge.', 'in the late and early centuries a debate over realism vs. antirealism was conducted as powerful scientific theories extended beyond the realm of the observable.', 'the term scientific method came into popular use in the twentieth century popping up in dictionaries and science textbooks although there was little scientific consensus over its meaning.', 'although there was growth through the middle of the twentieth century by the and numerous influential philosophers of science such as thomas kuhn and paul feyerabend had questioned the universality of the scientific method and in doing so largely replaced the notion of science as a homogeneous and universal method with that of it being a heterogeneous and local practice.', 'in particular paul feyerabend in the first edition of his book against method  argued against there being any universal rules of science .', 'later examples include physicist lee smolin essay there is no scientific method  and historian of science daniel thurs chapter in the book  which concluded that the scientific method is a myth or at best an idealization.', 'philosophers robert nola and howard sankey in their book  said that debates over scientific method continue and argued that feyerabend despite the title of  accepted certain rules of method and attempted to justify those rules with a meta methodology.', 'dna example the scientific method is the process by which science is carried out.', 'as in other areas of inquiry science through the scientific method can build on previous knowledge and develop a more sophisticated understanding of its topics of study over time.', 'this model can be seen to underlie the scientific revolution .', 'the ubiquitous element in the scientific method is empiricism .', 'this is in opposition to stringent forms of rationalism  the scientific method embodies that reason alone cannot solve a particular scientific problem.', 'a strong formulation of the scientific method is not always aligned with a form of empiricism in which the empirical data is put forward in the form of experience or other abstracted forms of knowledge in current scientific practice however the use of scientific modelling and reliance on abstract typologies and theories is normally accepted.', 'the scientific method is of necessity also an expression of an opposition to claims that e.g.', 'revelation  political or religious dogma  appeals to tradition commonly held beliefs common sense or importantly currently held theories are the only possible means of demonstrating truth.', 'different early expressions of empiricism and the scientific method can be found throughout history for instance with the ancient stoics  epicurus   alhazen   roger bacon  and william of ockham .', 'from the century onwards experiments were advocated by francis bacon  and performed by giambattista della porta   johannes kepler   and galileo galilei .', 'there was particular development aided by theoretical works by francisco sanches   john locke  george berkeley  and david hume .', 'the hypothetico-deductive model  formulated in the century is the ideal although it has undergone significant revision since first proposed for a more formal discussion see elements of the scientific method .', 'staddon  argues it is a mistake to try following rules  which are best learned through careful study of examples of scientific investigation.', 'the overall process involves making conjectures  hypotheses  deriving predictions from them as logical consequences and then carrying out experiments based on those predictions to determine whether the original conjecture was correct.', 'there are difficulties in a formulaic statement of method however.', 'though the scientific method is often presented as a fixed sequence of steps these actions are better considered as general principles.', 'not all steps take place in every scientific inquiry nor to the same degree and they are not always done in the same order.', 'as noted by scientist and philosopher william whewell  invention sagacity and genius  are required at every step.', 'the question can refer to the explanation of a specific observation  as in why is the sky blue but can also be open-ended as in how can i design a drug to cure this particular disease this stage frequently involves finding and evaluating evidence from previous experiments personal scientific observations or assertions as well as the work of other scientists.', 'if the answer is already known a different question that builds on the evidence can be posed.', 'when applying the scientific method to research determining a good question can be very difficult and it will affect the outcome of the investigation.', 'a hypothesis is a conjecture  based on knowledge obtained while formulating the question that may explain any given behavior.', 'the hypothesis might be very specific for example einstein equivalence principle or francis crick dna makes rna makes protein  or it might be broad for example unknown species of life dwell in the unexplored depths of the oceans.', 'a statistical hypothesis is a conjecture about a given statistical population .', 'for example the population might be the conjecture might be that a new drug will cure the disease in some of those people.', 'terms commonly associated with statistical hypotheses are null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis .', 'a null hypothesis is the conjecture that the statistical hypothesis is false for example that the new drug does nothing and that any cure is caused by chance .', 'researchers normally want to show that the null hypothesis is false.', 'the alternative hypothesis is the desired outcome that the drug does better than chance.', 'a final point a scientific hypothesis must be falsifiable  meaning that one can identify a possible outcome of an experiment that conflicts with predictions deduced from the hypothesis otherwise it cannot be meaningfully tested.', 'this step involves determining the logical consequences of the hypothesis.', 'one or more predictions are then selected for further testing.', 'the more unlikely that a prediction would be correct simply by coincidence then the more convincing it would be if the prediction were fulfilled the evidence is also stronger if the answer to the prediction is not already known due to the effects of hindsight bias see also postdiction .', 'ideally the prediction must also distinguish the hypothesis from likely alternatives if two hypotheses make the same prediction observing the prediction to be correct is not evidence for either one over the other.', 'these statements about the relative strength of evidence can be mathematically derived using bayes theorem .', 'this is an investigation of whether the real world behaves as predicted by the hypothesis.', 'scientists and other people test hypotheses by conducting experiments .', 'the purpose of an experiment is to determine whether observations of the real world agree with or conflict with the predictions derived from a hypothesis.', 'if they agree confidence in the hypothesis increases otherwise it decreases.', 'the agreement does not assure that the hypothesis is true future experiments may reveal problems.', 'karl popper advised scientists to try to falsify hypotheses i.e.', 'to search for and test those experiments that seem most doubtful.', 'large numbers of successful confirmations are not convincing if they arise from experiments that avoid risk.', 'experiments should be designed to minimize possible errors especially through the use of appropriate scientific controls .', 'for example tests of medical treatments are commonly run as double-blind tests .', 'test personnel who might unwittingly reveal to test subjects which samples are the desired test drugs and which are placebos  are kept ignorant of which are which.', 'such hints can bias the responses of the test subjects.', 'furthermore failure of an experiment does not necessarily mean the

obtain.', 'scientific inquiry generally aims to obtain knowledge in the form of testable explanations that scientists can use to predict the results of future experiments.', 'this allows scientists to gain a better understanding of the topic under study and later to use that understanding to intervene in its causal mechanisms such as to cure disease.', 'the better an explanation is at making predictions the more useful it frequently can be and the more likely it will continue to explain a body of evidence better than its alternatives.', 'the most successful explanations those which explain and make accurate predictions in a wide range of circumstances are often called scientific theories .', 'most experimental results do not produce large changes in human understanding improvements in theoretical scientific understanding typically result from a gradual process of development over time sometimes across different domains of science.', 'scientific models vary in the extent to which they have been experimentally tested and for how long and in their acceptance in the scientific community.', 'in general explanations become accepted over time as evidence accumulates on a given topic and the explanation in question proves more powerful than its alternatives at explaining the evidence.', 'often subsequent researchers re-formulate the explanations over time or combined explanations to produce new explanations.', 'tow sees the scientific method in terms of an evolutionary algorithm applied to science and technology.', 'scientific knowledge is closely tied to empirical findings and can remain subject to falsification if new experimental observations are incompatible with what is found.', 'that is no theory can ever be considered final since new problematic evidence might be discovered.', 'if such evidence is found a new theory may be proposed or more commonly it is found that modifications to the previous theory are sufficient to explain the new evidence.', 'the strength of a theory can be argued to relate to how long it has persisted without major alteration to its core principles.', 'theories can also become subsumed by other theories.', 'for example newton laws explained thousands of years of scientific observations of the planets almost perfectly .', 'however these laws were then determined to be special cases of a more general theory  relativity  which explained both the previously unexplained exceptions to newton laws and predicted and explained other observations such as the deflection of light by gravity .', 'thus in certain cases independent unconnected scientific observations can be connected unified by principles of increasing explanatory power.', 'since new theories might be more comprehensive than what preceded them and thus be able to explain more than previous ones successor theories might be able to meet a higher standard by explaining a larger body of observations than their predecessors.', 'for example the theory of evolution explains the diversity of life on earth  how species adapt to their environments and many other patterns observed in the natural world   its most recent major modification was unification with genetics to form the modern evolutionary synthesis .', 'in subsequent modifications it has also subsumed aspects of many other fields such as biochemistry and

diminishing the potentially harmful effects of circumstance and to a degree personal bias.', 'for example pre-existing beliefs can alter the interpretation of results as in confirmation bias  this is a heuristic that leads a person with a particular belief to see things as reinforcing their belief even if another observer might disagree in other words people tend to observe what they expect to observe.', 'a historical example is the belief that the legs of a galloping horse are splayed at the point when none of the horse legs touch the ground to the point of this image being included in paintings by its supporters.', 'however the first stop-action pictures of a horse gallop by eadweard muybridge showed this to be false and that the legs are instead gathered together.', 'another important human bias that plays a role is a preference for new surprising statements see appeal to novelty  which can result in a search for evidence that the new is true.', 'poorly attested beliefs

creativity.', 'in this sense it is not a mindless set of standards and procedures to follow\\nbut is rather an ongoing cycle  constantly developing more useful accurate and comprehensive models and methods.', 'for example when einstein developed the special and general theories of relativity he did not in any way refute or discount newton .', 'on the contrary if the astronomically massive the feather-light and the extremely fast are removed from einstein theories all phenomena newton could not have observed newton equations are what remain.', 'einstein theories are expansions and

coherent si unit may be a base unit in one context but a coherent derived unit in another.', 'for example the ampere is the coherent si unit for both electric current and magnetomotive force  but it

estimates at the time ensuring continuity with previous definitions of the base units.', 'as far as realisations what are believed to be the current best practical realisations of units are described in the so-called  ae which are also published by the bipm.', 'the abstract nature of the definitions of units is what makes it possible to improve and change the as science and technology develop without having to change the actual definitions themselves.', 'ah in a sense this way of defining the si units is no more abstract than the way derived units are traditionally defined in terms of the base units.', 'consider a particular derived unit for example the joule the unit of energy.', 'its definition in terms of the base units is  .', 'even if the practical realisations of the metre kilogram and second are available a practical realisation of the joule would require some sort of reference to the underlying physical definition of work or energysome actual physical procedure for realising the energy in the amount of one joule such that it can be compared to other instances of energy such as the energy content of gasoline put into a car or of electricity delivered to a household.', 'the situation with the defining constants and all of the si units is analogous.', 'in fact purely speaking the si units are defined we declared that it is the defining constant units that are now the base units with all other si units being derived units.', 'to make this clearer first note that each defining constant can be taken as determining the magnitude of that defining constant unit of measurement  for example the definition of defines the unit as   speed of one metre per second is equal to one th of the speed of light.', 'in this way the defining constants directly define the following seven units the hertz   a unit of the physical quantity of frequency note that problems can arise when dealing with frequency or the planck constant because the units of angular measure cycle or radian are omitted in si.', 'the metre per second   a unit of speed joule-second   a unit of action  coulomb   a unit of electric charge  joule per kelvin   a unit of both entropy and heat capacity  the inverse mole   a unit of a conversion constant between the amount of substance and the number of elementary entities atoms molecules etc.', 'and lumen per watt   a unit of a conversion constant between the physical power carried by electromagnetic radiation and the intrinsic ability of that same radiation to produce visual perception of brightness in humans.', 'further one can show using dimensional analysis  that every coherent si unit whether base or derived can be written as a unique product of powers of the units of the si defining constants in complete analogy to the fact that every coherent derived si unit can be written as a unique product of powers of the base si units.', 'for example the kilogram can be written as ai thus the kilogram is defined in terms of the three defining constants   and because on the one hand these three defining constants respectively define the units   and  aj while on the other hand the kilogram can be written in terms of these three units namely ak true the question of how to actually realise the kilogram in practice would at this point still be open but that is not really different from the fact that the question of how to actually realise the joule in practice is still in principle open even once one has achieved the practical realisations of the metre kilogram and second.', 'one consequence of the redefinition of the si is that the distinction between the base units and derived units is in principle not needed since any unit can be constructed directly from the seven defining constants.', 'nevertheless the distinction is retained because is useful and historically well established and also because the isoiec series of standards al specifies base and derived quantities that necessarily have the corresponding si units.', 'edit the current way of defining the si system is the result of a decades-long move towards increasingly abstract and idealised formulation in which the realisations of the units are separated conceptually from the definitions.', 'the great advantage of doing it this way is that as science and technologies develop new and superior realisations may be introduced without the need to redefine the units.', 'af units can now be realised with accuracy that is ultimately limited only by the quantum structure of nature and our technical abilities but not by the definitions themselves.', 'ag any valid equation of physics relating the defining constants to a unit can be used to realise the unit thus creating opportunities for innovation... with increasing accuracy as technology proceeds.', 'in practice the cipm consultative committees provide so-called  practical techniques  which are the descriptions of what are currently believed to be best experimental realisations of the units.', 'this system lacks the conceptual simplicity of using artefacts referred to as  as realisations of units to define those units with prototypes the definition and the realisation are one and the same.', 'am however using artefacts has two major disadvantages that as soon as it is technologically and scientifically feasible result in abandoning them as means for defining units.', 'aq one major disadvantage is that artefacts can be lost damaged as or changed.', 'at the other is that they largely cannot benefit from advancements in science and technology.', 'the last artefact used by the si was the international prototype kilogram ipk a particular cylinder of platinum-iridium  from to  the kilogram was by definition equal to the mass of the ipk.', 'concerns regarding its stability on the one hand and progress in precise measurements of the planck constant and the avogadro constant on the other led to a revision of the definition of the base units  put into effect on may .', 'this was the biggest change in the si system since it was first formally defined and established in  and it resulted in the definitions described above.', 'in the past there were also various other approaches to the definitions of some of the si units.', 'one made use of a specific physical state of a specific substance the triple point of water  which was

basis of the definition of length originally proposed in by the french abbot mouton .', 'carl friedrich gauss in march  the assembly adopted the committee proposed principles for the new decimal system of measure including the metre defined to be  of the length of the quadrant of earth meridian passing through paris and authorised a survey to precisely establish the length of the meridian.', 'in july  the committee proposed the names metre  are  litre and grave for the units of length area capacity and mass respectively.', 'the committee also proposed that multiples and submultiples of these units were to be denoted by decimal-based prefixes such as for a hundredth and for a thousand.', 'thomson maxwell      later during the process of adoption of the metric system the latin gramme and kilogramme  replaced the former provincial terms   and .', 'in june  based on the results of the meridian survey the standard mtre des archives and kilogramme des archives were deposited in the french national archives .', 'subsequently that year the metric system was adopted by law in france.', 'the french system was short-lived due to its unpopularity.', 'napoleon ridiculed it and in  introduced a replacement system the or customary measures which restored many of the old units but redefined in terms of the metric system.', 'during the first half of the century there was little consistency in the choice of preferred multiples of the base units typically the myriametre  metres was in widespread use in both france and parts of germany while the kilogram  grams rather than the myriagram was used for mass.', 'in  the german mathematician carl friedrich gauss  assisted by wilhelm weber  implicitly defined the second as a base unit when he quoted the earth magnetic field in terms of millimetres grams and seconds.', 'prior to this the strength of the earth magnetic field had only been described in relative terms .', 'the technique used by gauss was to equate the torque induced on a suspended magnet of known mass by the earth magnetic field with the torque induced on an equivalent system under gravity.', 'the resultant calculations enabled him to assign dimensions based on mass length and time to the magnetic field.', 'bo  a candlepower as a unit of illuminance was originally defined by an english law as the light produced by a pure spermaceti candle weighing pound  grams and burning at a specified rate.', 'spermaceti a waxy substance found in the heads of sperm whales was once used to make high-quality candles.', 'at this time the french standard of light was based upon the illumination from a carcel oil lamp .', 'the unit was defined as that illumination emanating from a lamp burning pure rapeseed oil at a defined rate.', 'it was accepted that ten standard candles were about equal to one carcel lamp.', 'edit metre convention a french-inspired initiative for international cooperation in metrology led to the signing in of the metre convention  also called treaty of the metre by nations.', 'bp  initially the convention only covered standards for the metre and the kilogram.', 'in  the metre convention was extended to include all physical units including the ampere and others thereby enabling the cgpm to address inconsistencies in the way that the metric system had been used.', 'a set of prototypes of the metre and prototypes of the kilogram bq in each case made of a  platinum - iridium alloy were manufactured by and accepted by the cgpm in .', 'one of each was selected at random to become the international prototype metre and international prototype kilogram that replaced the mtre des archives and kilogramme des archives respectively.', 'each member state was entitled to one of each of the remaining prototypes to serve as the national prototype for that country.', 'the treaty also established a number of international organisations to oversee the keeping of international standards of measurement.', 'br edit cgs system of units mks system of units in the  james clerk maxwell  william thomson later lord kelvin and others working under the auspices of the british association for the advancement of science  built on gauss work and formalised the concept of a coherent system of units with base units and derived units christened the centimetregramsecond system of units in .', 'the principle of coherence was successfully used to define a number of units of measure based on the cgs including the erg for energy  the dyne for force  the barye for pressure  the poise for dynamic viscosity and the stokes for kinematic viscosity .', 'in  the cipm published recommendations for writing the symbols for length area volume and mass but it was outside its domain to publish recommendations for other quantities.', 'beginning in about  physicists who had been using the symbol  mu for micrometre or micron  lambda for microlitre and  gamma for microgram started to use the symbols m l and g.  at the close of the century three different systems of units of measure existed for electrical measurements a cgs-based system for electrostatic units  also known as the gaussian or esu system a cgs-based system for electromechanical units emu and an international system based on units defined by the metre convention.', 'for electrical distribution systems.', 'attempts to resolve the electrical units in terms of length mass and time using dimensional analysis was beset with difficultiesthe dimensions depended on whether one used the esu or emu systems.', 'this anomaly was resolved in when giovanni giorgi published a paper in which he advocated using a fourth base unit alongside the existing three base units.', 'the fourth unit could be chosen to be electric current  voltage  or electrical resistance .', 'electric current with named unit  was chosen as the base unit and the other electrical quantities derived from it according to the laws of physics.', 'this became the foundation of the mks system of units.', 'in the late and early centuries a number of non-coherent units of measure based on the gramkilogram centimetremetre and second such as the pferdestrke metric horsepower for power   bs the darcy for permeability  and  millimetres of mercury  for barometric and blood pressure were developed or propagated some of which incorporated standard gravity in their definitions.', 'bt at the end of the second world war  a number of different systems of measurement were in use throughout the world.', 'some of these systems were metric system variations others were based on customary systems of measure like the u.s customary system and imperial system of the uk and british empire.', 'edit in  the cgpm commissioned a study to assess the measurement needs of the scientific technical and educational communities and to make recommendations for a single practical system of units of measurement suitable for adoption by all countries adhering to the metre convention.', 'this working document was .', 'based on this study the cgpm in defined an international system derived from six base units including units of temperature and optical radiation in addition to those for the mks system mass length and time units and giorgi current unit.', 'six base units were recommended the metre kilogram second ampere degree kelvin and candela.', 'the cgpm also approved the first formal recommendation for the writing of symbols in the metric system when the basis of the rules as they are now known was laid down.', 'these rules were subsequently extended and now cover unit symbols and names prefix symbols and names how quantity symbols should be written and used and how the values of quantities should be expressed.', 'edit in  the cgpm synthesised the results of the -year study into a set of resolutions.', 'the system was named the  abbreviated si from the french name .', 'edit when maxwell first introduced the concept of a coherent system he identified three quantities that could be used as base units mass length and time.', 'giorgi later identified the need for an electrical base unit for which the unit of electric current was chosen for si.', 'another three base units for temperature amount of substance and luminous intensity were added later.', 'the early metric systems defined a unit of weight as a base unit while the si defines an analogous unit of mass.', 'in everyday use these are mostly interchangeable but in scientific contexts the difference matters.', 'mass strictly the inertial mass represents a quantity of matter.', 'it relates the acceleration of a body to the applied force via newton law   force equals mass times acceleration.', 'a force of newton applied to a mass of will accelerate it at s .', 'this is true whether the object is floating in space or in a gravity field e.g.', 'at the earth surface.', 'weight is the force exerted on a body by a gravitational field and hence its weight depends on the strength of the gravitational field.', 'weight of a mass at the earth surface is  mass times the acceleration due to gravity which is .', 'at the earth surface and is about .', 'at the surface of mars.', 'since the acceleration due to gravity is local and varies by location and altitude on the earth weight is unsuitable for precision measurements of a property of a body and this makes a unit of weight unsuitable as a base unit.',

astronomical length scales.', 'the remaining two interactions the weak and strong nuclear forces  decline very rapidly with distance their effects are confined mainly to sub-atomic length scales.', 'the universe appears to have much more matter than antimatter  an asymmetry possibly related to the cp violation .', 'this imbalance between matter and antimatter is partially responsible for the existence of all matter existing today since matter and antimatter if equally produced at the big bang  would have completely annihilated each other and left only photons as a result of their interaction.', 'the universe also appears to have neither net momentum nor angular momentum  which follows accepted physical laws if the universe is finite.', 'these laws are gauss law and the

size from left to right then from top to bottom.', 'observational cosmology television signals according to the general theory of relativity far regions of space may never interact with ours even in

expanded.', 'this expansion is consistent with the observation that the light from distant galaxies has been redshifted  the photons emitted have been stretched to longer wavelengths and lower frequency during their journey.', 'analyses of type ia supernovae indicate that the spatial expansion is accelerating .', 'the more matter there is in the universe the stronger the mutual gravitational pull of the matter.', 'if the universe were dense then it would re-collapse into a gravitational singularity .', 'however if the universe contained too matter then the self-gravity would be too weak for astronomical structures like galaxies or planets to form.', 'since the big bang the universe has expanded monotonically .', 'perhaps unsurprisingly  our universe has just the right

dynamical forces acting on the particles in the universe which affect the expansion rate.', 'before  it was expected that the expansion rate would be decreasing as time went on due to the influence of gravitational interactions in the universe and thus there is an additional observable quantity in the universe called the deceleration parameter  which most cosmologists expected to be positive and related to the matter density of the universe.', 'in  the deceleration parameter was measured by two different groups to be negative approximately -.', 'which technically implies that the second

the west just after dusk or rising in the east a little while before dawn.', 'venus orbits the sun every .', 'earth days.', 'with a sidereal rotation period of earth days and a synodic day length of earth days it takes significantly longer to rotate about its axis than any other planet in the solar system  and does so in the opposite direction to all but uranus meaning the sun rises in the west and sets in the east.', 'venus does not have any moons  a distinction it shares only with mercury among the planets in the solar system.', 'venus is a terrestrial planet and is sometimes called earth sister planet because of their similar size mass proximity to the sun and bulk composition.', 'it is radically different from earth in other respects.', 'it has the densest atmosphere of the four terrestrial planets consisting of more than  carbon dioxide .', 'the atmospheric pressure at the planet surface is about times the sea level pressure of earth or roughly the pressure at  underwater on earth.', 'even though mercury is closer to the sun venus has the hottest surface of any planet in the solar system with a mean temperature of  .', 'venus is shrouded by an opaque layer of highly reflective clouds of sulfuric acid  preventing its surface from being seen from space in visible light .', 'it may have had water oceans in the past   but these would have vaporized as the temperature rose due to a runaway greenhouse effect .', 'the water has probably photodissociated  and the free hydrogen has been swept into interplanetary space by the solar wind because of the lack of a planetary magnetic field .', 'as one of the brightest objects in the sky venus has been a major fixture in human culture for as long as records have existed.', 'it has been made sacred to gods of many cultures and has been a prime inspiration for writers and poets as the morning star and evening star.', 'venus was the first planet to have its motions plotted across the sky as early as the second millennium bc.', 'due to its proximity to earth venus has been a prime target for early interplanetary exploration.', 'it was the first planet beyond earth visited by a spacecraft  mariner in  and the first to be successfully landed on by venera in .', 'venus thick clouds render observation of its surface impossible in visible light and the first detailed maps did not emerge until the arrival of the magellan orbiter in .', 'plans have been proposed for rovers or more complex missions but they are hindered by venus hostile surface conditions.', 'the possibility of life on venus has long been a topic of speculation and in recent years has received active research.', 'contents earth venus is one of the four terrestrial planets in the solar system meaning that it is a rocky body like earth.',

even though venus is nearly twice mercury distance from the sun and thus receives only  of mercury solar irradiance .', 'venus atmosphere is extremely rich in primordial noble gases compared to that of earth.', 'this enrichment indicates an early divergence from earth in evolution.', 'an unusually large comet impact  or accretion of a more massive primary atmosphere from solar nebula  have been proposed to explain the enrichment.', 'however the atmosphere is also depleted of radiogenic argon a proxy to mantle degassing suggesting an early shutdown of major magmatism.', 'studies have suggested that billions of years ago venus atmosphere could have been much more like the one surrounding the early earth and that there may have been substantial quantities of liquid water on the surface.', 'after a period of million to several billion years  solar forcing from rising luminosity of the sun caused the evaporation of the original water.', 'a runaway greenhouse effect was created once a critical level of greenhouse gases including water was added to its atmosphere.', 'although the surface conditions on venus are no longer hospitable to any earth-like life that may have formed before this event there is speculation on the possibility that life exists in the upper cloud layers of venus  up from the surface where the temperature ranges between and  and  and  but the environment is acidic.', 'the putative detection of phosphine in venus atmosphere with no known pathway for abiotic production led to speculation in september that there could be extant life currently present in the atmosphere.', 'later research not yet peer reviewed attributed the spectroscopic signal that was interpreted as phosphine to sulfur dioxide .', 'thermal inertia and the transfer of heat by winds in the lower atmosphere mean that the temperature of venus surface does not vary significantly between the planet two hemispheres those facing and not facing the sun despite venus extremely slow rotation.', 'winds at the surface are slow moving at a few kilometres per hour but because of the high density of the atmosphere at the surface they exert a significant amount of force against obstructions and transport dust and small stones across the surface.', 'this alone would make it difficult for a human to walk through even without the heat pressure and lack of oxygen.', 'above the dense layer are thick clouds consisting mainly of sulfuric acid  which is formed by sulfur dioxide and water through a chemical reaction resulting in sulfuric acid hydrate.', 'additionally the atmosphere consists of approximately  ferric chloride .', 'other possible constituents of the cloud particles are ferric sulfate  aluminium chloride and phosphoric anhydride .', 'clouds at different levels have different compositions and particle size distributions.', 'these clouds reflect and scatter about  of the sunlight that falls on them back into space and prevent visual observation of venus surface.', 'the permanent cloud cover means that although venus is closer than earth to the sun it receives less sunlight on the ground.', 'strong h  winds at the cloud tops go around venus about every four to five earth days.', 'winds on venus move at up to times the speed of its rotation whereas earth fastest winds are only  rotation speed.', 'the surface of venus is effectively isothermal  it retains a constant temperature not only between the two hemispheres but between the equator and the poles.', 'venus minute axial tilt less than  compared to on earthalso minimises seasonal temperature variation.', 'altitude is one of the few factors that affect venusian temperature.', 'the highest point on venus maxwell montes  is therefore the coolest point on venus with a temperature of about   and an atmospheric pressure of about .', '.', 'in  the spacecraft imaged a highly reflective substance at the tops of the highest mountain peaks that bore a strong resemblance to terrestrial snow.', 'this substance likely formed from a similar process to snow albeit at a far higher temperature.', 'too volatile to condense on the surface it rose in gaseous form to higher elevations where it is cooler and could precipitate.', 'the identity of this substance is not known with certainty but speculation has ranged from elemental tellurium to lead sulfide  galena .', 'although venus has no seasons as such in astronomers identified a cyclical variation in sunlight absorption by the atmosphere possibly caused by opaque absorbing particles suspended in the upper clouds.', 'the variation causes observed changes in the speed of venus zonal winds and appears to rise and fall in time with the sun -year sunspot cycle .', 'the existence of lightning in the atmosphere of venus has been controversial  since the first suspected bursts were detected by the soviet venera probes    in  venus express clearly detected whistler mode waves  the signatures of lightning.', 'their intermittent appearance indicates a pattern associated with weather activity.', 'according to these measurements the lightning rate is at least half of that on earth  however other instruments have not detected lightning at all.', 'the origin of any lightning remains unclear but could originate from the clouds or volcanoes.', 'in  discovered that a huge double atmospheric vortex exists at the south pole.', 'also discovered in  that an ozone layer exists high in the atmosphere of venus.', 'on january  esa scientists reported that the ionosphere of venus streams outwards in a manner similar to the ion tail seen streaming from a comet under similar conditions.', 'in december  and to a lesser extent in april and may  researchers working on japan mission observed bow shapes in the atmosphere of venus.', 'this was considered direct evidence of the existence of perhaps the largest stationary gravity waves in the solar system.', 'earth atmosphere atmosphere of venus hitran   wavenumber wavelengths mapping of venus geology of venus venera the venusian surface was a subject of speculation until some of its secrets were revealed by planetary science in the century.', 'venera landers in and returned images of a surface covered in sediment and relatively angular rocks.', 'the surface was mapped in detail by in .', 'the ground shows evidence of extensive volcanism  and the sulfur in the atmosphere may indicate that there have been recent eruptions.', 'about  of the venusian surface is covered by smooth volcanic plains consisting of  plains with wrinkle ridges and  smooth or lobate plains.', 'two highland continents make up the rest of its surface area one lying in the planet northern hemisphere and the other just south of the equator.', 'the northern continent is called ishtar terra after ishtar  the babylonian goddess of love and is about the size of australia.', 'maxwell montes  the highest mountain on venus lies on ishtar terra.', 'its peak is  above the venusian average surface elevation.', 'the southern continent is called aphrodite terra  after the greek goddess of love and is the larger of the two highland regions at roughly the size of south america.', 'a network of fractures and faults covers much of this area.', 'the absence of evidence of lava flow accompanying any of the visible calderas remains an enigma.', 'the planet has few impact craters  demonstrating that the surface is relatively young at million years old.', 'venus has some unique surface features in addition to the impact craters mountains and valleys commonly found on rocky planets.', 'among these are flat-topped volcanic features called  farra  which look somewhat like pancakes and range in size from to  to  across and from to   to  high radial star-like fracture systems called novae features with both radial and concentric fractures resembling spider webs known as  arachnoids  and coronae circular rings of fractures sometimes surrounded by a depression.', 'these features are volcanic in origin.', 'most venusian surface features are named after historical and mythological women.', 'exceptions are maxwell montes named after james clerk maxwell  and highland regions alpha regio  beta regio  and ovda regio .', 'the last three features were named before the current system was adopted by the international astronomical union  the body which oversees planetary nomenclature .', 'the longitude of physical features on venus are expressed relative to its prime meridian .', 'the original prime meridian passed through the radar-bright spot at the centre of the oval feature eve located south of alpha regio.', 'after the venera missions were completed the prime meridian was redefined to pass through the central peak in the crater ariadne on sedna planitia .', 'the stratigraphically oldest tessera terrains have consistently lower thermal emissivity than the surrounding basaltic plains measured by venus express and  indicating a different possibly a more felsic  mineral assemblage.', 'the mechanism to generate a large amount of felsic crust usually requires the presence of water ocean and plate tectonics  implying that habitable condition had existed on early venus.', 'however the nature of tessera terrains is far from certain.', 'volcanology of venus maat mons much of the venusian surface appears to have been shaped by volcanic activity.', 'venus has several times as many volcanoes as earth and it has large volcanoes that are over  across.', 'the only volcanic complex of this size on earth is the big island of hawaii.', 'this is not because venus is more volcanically active than earth but because its crust is older and is not subject the same erosion process.', 'earth oceanic crust is continually recycled by subduction at the boundaries of tectonic plates  and has an average age of about a hundred million years  whereas the venusian surface is estimated to be million years old.', 'several lines of evidence point to ongoing volcanic activity on venus.', 'sulfur dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere dropped by a factor of between and  jumped in  and again declined -fold.', 'this may mean that levels had been boosted several times by large volcanic eruptions.', 'it has also been suggested that venusian lightning discussed below could originate from volcanic activity i.e.', 'volcanic lightning .', 'in january  astronomers reported evidence that suggests that venus is currently volcanically active  specifically the detection of olivine  a volcanic product that would weather quickly on the planet surface.', 'in and  the first direct evidence for ongoing volcanism was observed by  in the form of four transient localized infrared hot spots within the rift zone ganis chasma   n  near the shield volcano maat mons .', 'three of the spots were observed in more than one successive orbit.', 'these spots are thought to represent lava freshly released by volcanic eruptions.', 'the actual temperatures are not known because the size of the hot spots could not be measured but are likely to have been in the    range relative to a normal temperature of  .', 'impact craters almost a thousand impact craters on venus are evenly distributed across its surface.', 'on other cratered bodies such as earth and the moon craters show a range of states of degradation.', 'on the moon degradation is caused by subsequent impacts whereas on earth it is caused by wind and rain erosion.', 'on venus about  of the craters are in pristine condition.', 'the number of craters together with their well-preserved condition indicates the planet underwent a global resurfacing event million years ago   followed by a decay in volcanism.', 'whereas earth crust is in continuous motion venus is thought to be unable to sustain such a process.', 'without plate tectonics to dissipate heat from its mantle venus instead undergoes a cyclical process in which mantle temperatures rise until they reach a critical level that weakens the crust.', 'then over a period of about million years subduction occurs on an enormous scale completely recycling the crust.', 'venusian craters range from to  to  in diameter.', 'no craters are smaller than km because of the effects of the dense atmosphere on incoming objects.', 'objects with less than a certain kinetic energy are slowed so much by the atmosphere that they do not create an impact crater.', 'incoming projectiles less than  in diameter will fragment and burn up in the atmosphere before reaching the ground.', 'differentiated without seismic data or knowledge of its moment of inertia  little direct information is available about the internal structure and geochemistry of venus.', 'the similarity in size and density between venus and earth suggests they share a similar internal structure a core  mantle  and crust .', 'like that of earth the venusian core is most likely at least partially liquid because the two planets have been cooling at about the same rate  although a completely solid core cannot be ruled out.', 'the slightly smaller size of venus means pressures are  lower in its deep interior than earth.', 'the predicted values for the moment of inertia based on planetary models suggest a core radius of .', 'this is in line with the first observation-based estimate of .', 'the principal difference between the two planets is the lack of evidence for plate tectonics on venus possibly because its crust is too strong to subduct without water to make it less viscous .', 'this results in reduced heat loss from the planet preventing it from cooling and providing a likely explanation for its lack of an internally generated magnetic field .', 'instead venus may lose its internal heat in periodic major resurfacing events.', 'in  venera found venus magnetic field to be much weaker than that of earth.', 'this magnetic field is induced by an interaction between the ionosphere and the solar wind    rather than by an internal dynamo as in the earth core .', 'venus small induced magnetosphere provides negligible protection to the atmosphere against cosmic radiation .', 'the lack of an intrinsic magnetic field at venus was surprising given that it is similar to earth in size and was expected also to contain a dynamo at its core.', 'a dynamo requires three things a conducting liquid rotation and convection .', 'the core is thought to be electrically conductive and although its rotation is often thought to be too slow simulations show it is adequate to produce a dynamo.', 'this implies that the dynamo is missing because of a lack of convection in venus core.', 'on earth convection occurs in the liquid outer layer of the core because the bottom of the liquid layer is much higher in temperature than the top.', 'on venus a global resurfacing event may have shut down plate tectonics and led to a reduced heat flux through the crust.', 'this insulating effect would cause the mantle temperature to increase thereby reducing the heat flux out of the core.', 'as a result no internal geodynamo is available to drive a magnetic field.', 'instead the heat from the core is reheating the crust.', 'one possibility is that venus has no solid inner core  or that its core is not cooling so that the entire liquid part of the core is at approximately the same temperature.', 'another possibility is that its core has already completely solidified.', 'the state of the core is highly dependent on the concentration of sulfur  which is unknown at present.', 'the weak magnetosphere around venus means that the solar wind is interacting directly with its outer atmosphere.', 'here ions of hydrogen and oxygen are being created by the dissociation of water molecules from ultraviolet radiation.', 'the solar wind then supplies energy that gives some of these ions sufficient velocity to escape venus gravity field.', 'this erosion process results in a steady loss of low-mass hydrogen helium and oxygen ions whereas higher-mass molecules such as carbon dioxide are more likely to be retained.', 'atmospheric erosion by the solar wind could have led to the loss of most of venus water during the first billion years after it formed.', 'however the planet may have retained a dynamo for its first billion years so the water loss may have occurred more recently.',

change that would have occurred over the course of billions of years.', 'the rotation period of venus may represent an equilibrium state between tidal locking to the sun gravitation which tends to slow rotation and an atmospheric tide created by solar heating of the thick venusian atmosphere.', 'the -day average interval between successive close approaches to earth is almost exactly equal to

likely had at least one moon created by a huge impact event billions of years ago.', 'about million years later according to the study another impact reversed the planet spin direction and caused the venusian moon gradually to spiral inward until it collided with venus.', 'if later impacts created moons these were removed in the same way.', 'an alternative explanation for the lack of satellites is the effect of strong solar tides which can destabilize large satellites orbiting the inner terrestrial planets.', 'to the naked eye  venus appears as a white point of light brighter than any other

the movements of venus appear to be discontinuous it disappears due to its proximity to the sun for many days at a time and then reappears on the other horizon some cultures did not recognize venus as a single entity  instead they assumed it to be two separate stars on each horizon the morning and evening star.', 'nonetheless a cylinder seal from the jemdet nasr period and the venus tablet of ammisaduqa from the first babylonian dynasty indicate that the ancient sumerians already knew that the morning and evening stars were the same celestial object.', 'in the old babylonian period the planet venus was known as ninsi and later as dilbat.', 'the name ninsi translates to divine lady illumination of heaven which refers to venus as the brightest visible star.', 'earlier spellings of the name were written with the cuneiform sign  su meaning to be red and the original meaning may have been divine lady of the redness of heaven in reference to the colour of the morning and evening sky.',

'gravitational capture of a pre-formed moon  depends on an unfeasibly extended atmosphere of earth to dissipate the energy of the passing moon.', 'a co-formation of earth and the moon together in the primordial accretion disk does not explain the depletion of metals in the moon.', 'none of these hypotheses can account for the high angular momentum of the earthmoon system.', 'the prevailing theory

valleys rift valleys while the giant-impact theory explains many lines of evidence some questions are still unresolved most of which involve the moon composition.', 'in  a team at the carnegie institute of washington reported the most precise measurement of the isotopic signatures of lunar rocks.', 'the rocks from the apollo program had the same isotopic signature as rocks from earth differing from almost all other bodies in the solar system.', 'this observation was unexpected because most of the material that formed the moon was thought to come from theia and it was announced in that there was less than a  chance that theia and earth had identical isotopic signatures.', 'other apollo lunar samples had in the same titanium isotopes composition as earth  which conflicts with what is expected if the moon formed far from earth or is derived from theia.', 'these discrepancies may be explained by variations of the giant-impact theory.', 'the moon is a very slightly scalene ellipsoid due to tidal stretching with its long axis displaced from facing the earth due to gravitational anomalies from impact basins.', 'its shape is more elongated than current tidal forces can account for.', 'this bulge indicates that the moon solidified when it orbited at half its current distance to the earth and that it is now too cold for its shape to adjust to its orbit.', 'internal

billion years ago its magnetic field strength was likely close to that of earth today.', 'this early dynamo field apparently expired by about one billion years ago after the lunar core had completely crystallized.', 'theoretically some of the remnant magnetization may originate from transient magnetic fields generated during large impacts through the expansion of plasma clouds.', 'these clouds are generated during large impacts in an ambient magnetic field.', 'this is supported by the location of the largest crustal magnetizations situated near the antipodes of the giant impact basins.',

relatively dust-free features that because of the lack of erosion by infalling debris appeared to be only million years old.', 'moonquakes and releases of gas also indicate some continued lunar activity.', 'evidence of recent lunar volcanism has been identified at irregular mare patches  some less than million years old.', 'this raises the possibility of a much warmer lunar mantle than previously believed at least on the near side where the deep crust is substantially warmer because of the greater concentration of radioactive elements.', 'evidence has been found for million years old basaltic volcanism within the crater lowell   inside the orientale basin.', 'some combination of an initially hotter mantle and local enrichment of heat-producing elements in the mantle could be responsible for prolonged activities on the far side in the orientale basin.', 'the lighter-colored regions of the moon are called  or more commonly  because they are higher than most maria.', 'they have been radiometrically dated to having formed .', 'years ago and may represent plagioclase cumulates of the lunar magma ocean.', 'in contrast to earth no major lunar mountains are believed to have formed as a result of tectonic events.', 'the concentration of maria on the near side likely reflects the substantially thicker crust of the highlands of the far side which may have formed in a slow-velocity impact of a second moon of earth a few tens of millions of years after the moon formation.', 'alternatively it may be a consequence of asymmetrical tidal heating when the moon was much closer to the earth.', 'list of craters on the moon daedalus moon far side a major geologic process that has affected the moon surface is impact cratering   with craters formed when asteroids and comets collide with the lunar surface.', 'there are estimated to be roughly  craters wider than .', 'on the moon near side.', 'the lunar geologic timescale is based on the most prominent impact events including nectaris  imbrium  and orientale  structures characterized by multiple rings of uplifted material between hundreds and thousands of kilometers in diameter and associated with a broad apron of ejecta deposits that form a regional stratigraphic horizon .', 'the lack of an atmosphere weather and recent geological processes mean that many of these craters are well-preserved.', 'although only a few multi-ring basins have been definitively dated they are useful for assigning relative ages.', 'because impact craters accumulate at a nearly constant rate counting the number of craters per unit area can be used to estimate the age of the surface.', 'the radiometric ages of impact-melted rocks collected during the apollo missions cluster between .', 'and .', 'years old this has been used

rate computed from models based solely on direct micrometeorite impacts.', 'reiner gamma gravity of the moon grail the gravitational field of the moon has been measured through tracking the doppler shift of radio signals emitted by orbiting spacecraft.', 'the main lunar gravity features are mascons  large positive gravitational anomalies associated with some of the giant impact basins partly caused by the dense mare basaltic lava flows that fill those basins.', 'the anomalies greatly influence the orbit of spacecraft about the moon.', 'there are some puzzles lava flows by themselves

wind  leaving traces of water which could possibly persist in cold permanently shadowed craters at either pole on the moon.', 'computer simulations suggest that up to   of the surface may be in permanent shadow.', 'the presence of usable quantities of water on the moon is an important factor in rendering lunar habitation as a cost-effective plan the alternative of transporting water from earth would be prohibitively expensive.', 'in years since signatures of water have been found to exist on the lunar surface.', 'in  the bistatic radar experiment located on the clementine spacecraft indicated the existence of small frozen pockets of water close to the surface.', 'however later radar observations by arecibo  suggest these findings may rather be rocks ejected from young impact craters.', 'in  the neutron spectrometer on the spacecraft showed that high concentrations of hydrogen are present in the first meter of depth in the regolith near the polar regions.', 'volcanic lava

for the first time definitive evidence for water-ice on the lunar surface.', 'the data revealed the distinct reflective signatures of water-ice as opposed to dust and other reflective substances.', 'the ice deposits were found on the north and south poles although it is more abundant in the south where water is trapped in permanently shadowed craters and crevices allowing it to persist as ice on

h. g. wells  the war of the worlds  published in  in which martians seek to escape their dying planet by invading earth.', 'influential works included ray bradbury the martian chronicles  in which human explorers accidentally destroy a martian civilization edgar rice burroughs  series  c. s. lewis  novel out of the silent planet   and a number of robert a. heinlein stories before the mid-sixties.', 'jonathan swift made reference to the moons of mars about years before their actual discovery by asaph hall  detailing reasonably accurate descriptions of their orbits in the chapter of

ideas about mars had to be abandoned and a vogue for accurate realist depictions of human colonies on mars developed the best known of which may be kim stanley robinson trilogy .', 'pseudo-scientific

planetary radius and fourth-largest planetary mass in the solar system .', 'uranus is similar in composition to neptune  and both have bulk chemical compositions which differ from that of the larger gas giants jupiter and saturn .', 'for this reason scientists often classify uranus and neptune as  ice giants  to distinguish them from the other giant planets.', 'uranus atmosphere is similar to jupiter and saturn in its primary composition of hydrogen and helium  but it contains more  ices  such as water ammonia  and methane  along with traces of other hydrocarbons .', 'it has the coldest planetary atmosphere in the solar system with a minimum temperature of   and has a complex layered cloud structure with water thought to make up the lowest clouds and methane the uppermost layer of clouds.', 'the interior of uranus is mainly composed of ices and rock.', 'like the other giant planets  uranus has a ring system  a magnetosphere  and numerous moons .', 'the uranian system has a unique configuration because its axis of rotation is tilted sideways nearly into the plane of its solar orbit.', 'its north and south poles therefore lie where most other planets have their equators

the planet.', 'observations from earth have shown seasonal change and increased weather activity as uranus approached its equinox in .', 'wind speeds can reach metres per second h .', 'contents like the classical planets  uranus is visible to the naked eye but it was never recognised as a planet by ancient observers because of its dimness and slow orbit.', 'sir william herschel first observed uranus on march  leading to its discovery as a planet expanding the known boundaries of the solar system for the first time in history and making uranus the first planet classified as such with the aid of a telescope .', 'william herschel uranus had been observed on many occasions before its recognition as a planet but it was generally mistaken for a star.', 'possibly the earliest known observation was by hipparchos  who in bc might have recorded it as a star for his star catalogue that was later incorporated into ptolemy almagest .', 'the earliest definite sighting was in  when john flamsteed observed it at least six times cataloguing it as tauri .', 'the french astronomer pierre charles le monnier observed uranus at least twelve times between and   including on four consecutive nights.', 'sir william herschel observed uranus on march from the garden of his house at new king street in bath somerset  england now the herschel museum of astronomy   and initially reported it on april  as a comet .', 'with a homemade .-inch reflecting telescope herschel engaged in a series of observations on the parallax of the fixed stars.', 'herschel recorded in his journal in the quartile near tauri ... either a nebulous star or perhaps a comet.', 'on march he noted i looked for the comet or nebulous star and found that it is a comet for it has changed its place.', 'when he presented his discovery to the royal society  he continued to assert that he had found a comet but also implicitly compared it to a planet  the power i had on when i first saw the comet was .', 'from experience i know that the diameters of the fixed stars are not proportionally magnified with higher powers as planets are therefore i now put the powers at and  and found that the diameter of the comet increased in proportion to the power as it ought to be on the supposition of its not being a fixed star while the diameters of the stars to which i compared it were not increased in the same ratio.', 'moreover the comet being magnified much beyond what its light would admit of appeared hazy and ill-defined with these great powers while the stars preserved that lustre and distinctness which from many thousand observations i knew they would retain.', 'the sequel has shown that my surmises were well-founded this proving to be the comet we have lately observed.', 'herschel notified the astronomer royal nevil maskelyne of his discovery and received this flummoxed reply from him on april  i don know what to call it.', 'it is as likely to be a regular planet moving in an orbit nearly circular to the sun as a comet moving in a very eccentric ellipsis.', 'i have not yet seen any coma or tail to it.', 'although herschel continued to describe his new object as a comet other astronomers had already begun to suspect otherwise.', 'finnish-swedish astronomer anders johan lexell  working in russia was the first to compute the orbit of the new object.', 'its nearly circular orbit led him to a conclusion that it was a planet rather than a comet.', 'berlin astronomer johann elert bode described herschel discovery as a moving star that can be deemed a hitherto unknown planet-like object circulating beyond the orbit of saturn.', 'bode concluded that its near-circular orbit was more like a planet than a comet.', 'the object was soon universally accepted as a new planet.', 'by  herschel acknowledged this to royal society president joseph banks  by the observation of the most eminent astronomers in europe it appears that the new star which i had the honour of pointing out to them in march  is a primary planet of our solar system.', 'in recognition of his achievement king george iii gave herschel an annual stipend of on condition that he move to windsor so that the royal family could look through his telescopes equivalent to  in .', 'the name of uranus references the ancient greek deity of the sky uranus  ancient greek   the father of cronus  saturn  and grandfather of zeus  jupiter  which in latin became  urans .', 'it is the only planet whose english name is derived directly from a figure of greek mythology .', 'the adjectival form of uranus is uranian.', 'the pronunciation of the name preferred among astronomers is     with stress on the first syllable as in latin  in contrast to    with stress on the second syllable and a long  though both are considered acceptable.', 'f consensus on the name was not reached until almost years after the planet discovery.', 'during the original discussions following discovery maskelyne asked herschel to do the astronomical world the faver  sic  to give a name to your planet which is entirely your own and which we are so much obliged to you for the discovery of.', 'in response to maskelyne request herschel decided to name the object george star or the georgian planet in honour of his new patron king george iii.', 'he explained this decision in a letter to joseph banks  in the fabulous ages of ancient times the appellations of mercury venus mars jupiter and saturn were given to the planets as being the names of their principal heroes and divinities.', 'in the present more philosophical era it would hardly be allowable to have recourse to the same method and call it juno pallas apollo or minerva for a name to our new heavenly body.', 'the first consideration of any particular event or remarkable incident seems to be its chronology if in any future age it should be asked when this last-found planet was discovered it would be a very satisfactory answer to say the reign of king george the third.', 'herschel proposed name was not popular outside britain and alternatives were soon proposed.', 'astronomer jrme lalande proposed that it be named in honour of its discoverer.', 'swedish astronomer erik prosperin proposed the name  which was supported by other astronomers who liked the idea to commemorate the victories of the british royal naval fleet in the course of the american revolutionary war by calling the new planet even or .', 'in a march treatise bode proposed  the latinised version of the greek god of the sky ouranos .', 'bode argued that the name should follow the mythology so as not to stand out as different from the other planets and that uranus was an appropriate name as the father of the first generation of the titans .', 'he also noted that elegance of the name in that just as saturn was the father of jupiter  the new planet should be named after the father of saturn.', 'in  bode royal academy colleague martin klaproth named his newly discovered element uranium in support of bode choice.', 'ultimately bode suggestion became the most widely used and became universal in when hm nautical almanac office  the final holdout switched from using to .', 'uranus has two astronomical symbols .', 'the first to be proposed  g was suggested by lalande in .', 'in a letter to herschel lalande described it as   a globe surmounted by the first letter of your surname.', 'a later proposal  h is a hybrid of the symbols for mars and the sun because uranus was the sky in greek mythology which was thought to be dominated by the combined powers of the sun and mars.', 'uranus is called by a variety of translations in other languages.', 'in chinese  japanese  korean  and vietnamese  its name is literally translated as the sky king star  .', 'in thai  its official name is   as in english.', 'its other name in thai is   star of mtyu after the sanskrit word for  mrtyu  .', 'in mongolian  its name is   translated as of the sky reflecting its namesake god role as the ruler of the heavens.', 'in hawaiian  its name is  a loanword for the discoverer herschel.', 'in mori  its name is .', 'infrared rings moons hubble space telescope nicmos camera uranus orbits the sun once every years taking an average of seven years to pass through each of the dozen constellations of the zodiac.', 'in  the planet will have made its third complete orbit around the sun since being discovered in .', 'the planet has returned to the point of its discovery northeast of zeta tauri twice since then in and  one day later each time as the precession of the equinoxes has shifted it west every years.', 'uranus will return to this location again in .', 'its average distance from the sun is roughly au  billion km  mi .', 'the difference between its minimum and maximum distance from the sun is .', 'au larger than that of any other planet though not as large as that of dwarf planet pluto .', 'the intensity of sunlight varies inversely with the square of distance and so on uranus at about times the distance from the sun compared to earth it is about  the intensity of light on earth.', 'the orbital elements of uranus were first calculated in by pierre-simon laplace .', 'with time discrepancies began to appear between the predicted and observed orbits and in  john couch adams first proposed that the differences might be due to the gravitational tug of an unseen planet.', 'in  urbain le verrier began his own independent research into uranus orbit.', 'on september  johann gottfried galle located a new planet  later named neptune  at nearly the position predicted by le verrier.', 'the rotational period of the interior of uranus is  .', 'as on all the giant planets  its upper atmosphere experiences strong winds in the direction of rotation.', 'at some latitudes such as about degrees south visible features of the atmosphere move much faster making a full rotation in as little as hours.', 'the uranian axis of rotation is approximately parallel with the plane of the solar system with an axial tilt of .', 'as defined by prograde rotation.', 'this gives it seasonal changes completely unlike those of the other planets.', 'near the solstice  one pole faces the sun continuously and the other faces away.', 'only a narrow strip around the equator experiences a rapid daynight cycle but with the sun low over the horizon.', 'at the other side of uranus orbit the orientation of the poles towards the sun is reversed.', 'each pole gets around of continuous sunlight followed by of darkness.', 'near the time of the equinoxes  the sun faces the equator of uranus giving a period of daynight cycles similar to those seen on most of the other planets.', 'uranus reached its most recent equinox on december .', 'one result of this axis orientation is that averaged over the uranian year the polar regions of uranus receive a greater energy input from the sun than its equatorial regions.', 'nevertheless uranus is hotter at its equator than at its poles.', 'the underlying mechanism that causes this is unknown.', 'the reason for uranus unusual axial tilt is also not known with certainty but the usual speculation is that during the formation of the solar

not always so dim.', 'this information implies that the visible pole brightens some time before the solstice and darkens after the equinox.', 'detailed analysis of the visible and microwave data

northern polar collar arose and the southern collar became nearly invisible although the zonal wind profile remained slightly asymmetric with northern winds being somewhat slower than southern.', 'the mechanism of these physical changes is still not clear.', 'near the summer and winter solstices uranus hemispheres lie alternately either in full glare of the sun rays or facing deep space.', 'the brightening of the sunlit hemisphere is thought to result from the local thickening of the methane clouds and haze layers located in the troposphere.', 'the bright collar at latitude is also connected with methane clouds.', 'other changes in the southern polar region can be explained by changes in the lower cloud layers.', 'the variation of the microwave emission from uranus is probably caused by

bouvard death the position of neptune was predicted from his observations independently by john couch adams and urbain le verrier .', 'neptune was subsequently observed with a telescope on september  by johann galle within a degree of the position predicted by le verrier.', 'its largest moon triton  was discovered shortly thereafter though none of the planet remaining known moons were located telescopically until the century.', 'the planet distance from earth gives it a very small apparent size making it challenging to study with earth-based telescopes.', 'neptune was visited by voyager  when it flew by the planet on august  remains the only spacecraft to visit neptune.', 'the advent of the hubble space telescope and large ground-based telescopes with adaptive optics has recently allowed for additional detailed observations from afar.', 'like jupiter and saturn neptune atmosphere is composed primarily of hydrogen and helium  along with traces of hydrocarbons and possibly nitrogen  though it contains a higher proportion of ices such as water ammonia and methane .', 'however similar to uranus its interior is primarily composed of ices and rock  uranus and neptune are normally considered  ice giants  to emphasise this distinction.', 'traces of methane in the outermost regions in part account for the planet blue appearance  though an unknown component is believed to color neptune a deeper blue compared to uranus.', 'in contrast to the hazy relatively featureless atmosphere of uranus neptune atmosphere has active and visible weather patterns.', 'for example at the time of the flyby in  the planet southern hemisphere had a great dark spot comparable to the great red spot on jupiter.', 'more recently in  a newer main dark spot and smaller dark spot were identified and studied.', 'in addition these weather patterns are driven by the strongest sustained winds of any planet in the solar system with recorded wind speeds as high as h s .', 'because of its

both occasions galileo seems to have mistaken neptune for a fixed star when it appeared closein conjunction to jupiter in the night sky .', 'hence he is not credited with neptune discovery.', 'at his first observation in december  neptune was almost stationary in the sky because it had just turned retrograde that day.', 'this apparent backward motion is created when earth orbit takes it past an outer planet.', 'because neptune was only beginning its yearly retrograde cycle the motion of the planet was far too slight to be detected with galileo small telescope.', 'in  a study suggested that galileo was at least aware that the star he had observed had moved relative to the fixed stars .', 'in  alexis bouvard published astronomical tables of the orbit of neptune neighbour uranus .',

compatriots.', 'in june  upon seeing le verrier first published estimate of the planet longitude and its similarity to adams estimate airy persuaded james challis to search for the planet.', 'challis vainly scoured the sky throughout august and september.', 'meanwhile le verrier sent a letter and urged berlin observatory astronomer johann gottfried galle to search with the observatory refractor .', 'heinrich d  a student at the observatory suggested to galle that they could compare a recently drawn chart of the sky in the region of le verrier predicted location with the current sky to seek the displacement characteristic of a planet  as opposed to a fixed star.', 'on the evening of september  the day galle received the letter he discovered neptune just northeast of iota aquarii  from the   position le verrier had predicted it to be   about from adams prediction and on the border of aquarius and capricornus according to the modern iau constellation boundaries.', 'challis later realised that he had observed the planet twice on and august but did not recognise it as a planet because he lacked an up-to-date star map and was distracted by his concurrent work on comet observations.', 'in the wake of the discovery there was a heated nationalistic rivalry between the french and the british over who deserved credit for the discovery.', 'eventually an international consensus emerged that le verrier and adams deserved joint credit.', 'since  dennis rawlins has questioned the credibility of adams claim to co-discovery and the issue was re-evaluated by historians with the return in of the neptune papers historical documents to the royal observatory greenwich .', 'shortly after its discovery neptune was referred to simply as the planet exterior to uranus or as le verrier planet.', 'the first suggestion for a name came from galle who proposed the name janus .', 'in england challis put forward the name oceanus .', 'claiming the right to name his discovery le verrier quickly proposed the name for this new planet though falsely stating that this had been officially approved by the french bureau des longitudes .', 'in october he sought to name the planet  after himself and he had loyal support in this from the observatory director franois arago .', 'this suggestion met with stiff resistance outside france.', 'french almanacs quickly reintroduced the name for uranus after that planet discoverer sir william herschel  and for the new planet.', 'struve came out in favour of the name on december  to the saint petersburg academy of sciences .', 'soon

precisely.', 'current models suggest that the matter density in the outer regions of the solar system was too low to account for the formation of such large bodies from the traditionally accepted method of core accretion  and various hypotheses have been advanced to explain their formation.', 'one is that the ice giants were not formed by core accretion but from instabilities within the original protoplanetary disc and later had their atmospheres blasted away by radiation from a nearby massive ob star .', 'an alternative concept is that they formed closer to the sun where the matter density was higher and then subsequently migrated to their current orbits after the removal of the gaseous protoplanetary disc.', 'this hypothesis of migration after formation is favoured due to its ability to better explain the occupancy of the populations of small objects observed in the trans-neptunian region.', 'the current most widely accepted    explanation of the details of this hypothesis

red giants and not affected by dust extinction detected the predicted overabundance in the scutumcentaurus arm but not in the carinasagittarius arm the scutumcentaurus arm contains approximately  more red giants than would be expected in the absence of a spiral arm.', 'this observation suggests that the milky way possesses only two major stellar arms the perseus arm and the scutumcentaurus arm.', 'the rest of the arms contain excess gas but not excess old stars.', 'in december  astronomers found that the distribution of young stars and star-forming regions matches the four-arm spiral description of the milky way.', 'thus the milky way appears to have two spiral arms as traced by old stars and four spiral arms as traced by gas and young stars.', 'the explanation for this apparent

suggested that the milky way contains two different spiral patterns an inner one formed by the sagittarius arm that rotates fast and an outer one formed by the carina and perseus arms whose rotation velocity is slower and whose arms are tightly wound.', 'in this scenario suggested by numerical simulations of the dynamics of the different spiral arms the outer pattern would form an outer pseudoring   and the two patterns would be connected by the cygnus arm.', 'outside of the major spiral arms is the monoceros ring or outer ring a ring of gas and stars torn from other galaxies billions of years ago.', 'however several members of the scientific community recently restated their position affirming the monoceros structure is nothing more than an over-density produced by the flared and warped thick disk of the milky way.', 'the structure of the milky way disk is warped along an s curve .', 'edit the galactic disk is surrounded by a spheroidal halo of old stars and globular clusters of which  lie within  light-years  of the galactic center.', 'however a few globular clusters have been found farther such as and at more than -years from the galactic center.', 'about  of the milky way clusters are on retrograde orbits  which means they move in the opposite direction from the milky way rotation.', 'the globular clusters can follow rosette orbits about the milky way in contrast to the elliptical orbit of a planet around a star.', 'although the disk contains dust that obscures the view in some wavelengths the halo component does not.', 'active star formation takes place in the disk especially in the spiral arms which represent areas of high density but does not take place in the halo as there is little cool gas to collapse into stars.', 'open clusters are also located primarily in the disk.', 'discoveries in the early have added dimension to the knowledge of the milky way structure.', 'with the discovery that the disk of the andromeda galaxy  extends much farther than previously thought  the possibility of the disk of the milky way extending farther is apparent and this is supported by evidence from the discovery of the outer arm extension of the cygnus arm   and of a similar extension of the scutumcentaurus arm .', 'with the discovery of the sagittarius dwarf elliptical galaxy came the discovery of a ribbon of galactic debris as the polar orbit of the dwarf and its interaction with the milky way tears it apart.', 'similarly with the discovery of the canis major dwarf galaxy  it was found that a ring of galactic debris from its interaction with the milky way encircles the galactic disk.', 'the sloan digital sky survey of the northern sky shows a huge and diffuse structure spread out across an area around  the size of a

proposed likely interpretation is that a dwarf galaxy is merging with the milky way.', 'this galaxy is tentatively named the virgo stellar stream and is found in the direction of virgo about  light-years  away.', 'edit in addition to the stellar halo the chandra x-ray observatory  xmm-newton  and have provided evidence that there is a gaseous halo with a large amount of hot gas.', 'the

matter the rotation speed would decrease with distance from the center.', 'however the observed curve is relatively flat indicating that there is additional mass that cannot be detected directly with electromagnetic radiation.', 'this inconsistency is attributed to dark matter.', 'the rotation curve of the milky way agrees with the universal rotation curve of spiral galaxies the best evidence for the existence of dark matter in galaxies.', 'alternatively a minority of astronomers propose that a modification of the law of gravity may explain the observed rotation curve.', 'edit galaxy formation

indicate that billion years ago it merged with a particularly large galaxy that has been labeled the kraken .', 'however properties of the milky way such as stellar mass angular momentum  and metallicity in its outermost regions suggest it has undergone no mergers with large galaxies in the last billion years.', 'this lack of recent major mergers is unusual among similar spiral galaxies its neighbour the andromeda galaxy appears to have a more typical history shaped by more recent mergers with relatively large galaxies.', 'according to recent studies the milky way as well as the andromeda galaxy lie in what in the galaxy colormagnitude diagram is known as the green valley a region populated by galaxies in transition from the blue cloud galaxies actively forming new stars to the red sequence galaxies that lack star formation.', 'star-formation activity in green valley galaxies is slowing as they run out of star-forming gas in the interstellar medium.', 'in simulated galaxies with similar properties star formation will typically have been extinguished within about five billion years from now even accounting for the expected short-term increase in the rate of star formation due to the collision between both the milky way and the andromeda galaxy.', 'in fact measurements of other galaxies similar to the milky way suggest it is among the reddest and brightest

'this discrepancy is still not fully explained.', 'in january  researchers reported that the heretofore unexplained warp in the disk of the milky way has now been mapped and found to be a ripple or vibration set up by the large and small magellanic clouds as they orbit the milky way causing vibrations when they pass through its edges.', 'previously these two galaxies at around  of the mass of the milky way were considered too small to influence the milky way.', 'however in a computer model the movement of these two galaxies creates a dark matter wake that amplifies their influence on the larger milky way.', 'current measurements suggest the andromeda galaxy is approaching us at to s  to .', 'in to billion years there may be an andromedamilky way collision  depending on the importance of unknown lateral components to the galaxies relative motion.', 'if they collide the chance of individual stars colliding with each other is extremely low but instead the two galaxies will merge to

milky way mythology in the babylonian epic poem enma eli  the milky way is created from the severed tail of the primeval salt water dragoness tiamat  set in the sky by marduk  the babylonian national god  after slaying her.', 'this story was once thought to have been based on an older sumerian version in which tiamat is instead slain by enlil of nippur    but is now thought to be purely an invention of babylonian propagandists with the intention to show marduk as superior to the sumerian deities.', 'llys dn literally the court of dn  is the traditional welsh name for the constellation cassiopeia .', 'at least three of dn children also have astronomical associations caer gwydion the fortress of gwydion  is the traditional welsh name for the milky way   and caer arianrhod the fortress of arianrhod  being the constellation of corona borealis .', 'in western culture the name milky way is derived from its appearance as a dim un-resolved milky glowing band arching across the night sky.', 'the term is a translation of the classical latin  in turn derived from the hellenistic greek  short for   milky circle.', 'the ancient greek   from root - milk  forming adjectives is also the root of galaxy the name for our and later all such collections of stars.', 'in greek mythology  the milky way was formed after the trickster god hermes suckled the infant heracles at the breast of hera  the queen of the gods while she was asleep.', 'when hera awoke she tore heracles away from her breast and splattered her breast milk across the heavens.', 'in another version of the story athena  the patron goddess of heroes tricked hera into suckling heracles voluntarily   but he bit her nipple so hard that she flung him away spraying milk everywhere.', 'the milky way or milk circle was just one of circles the greeks identified in the sky others being the zodiac  the meridian  the horizon  the equator  the tropics of cancer and capricorn  arctic and antarctic circles  and two colure circles passing through both poles.', 'edit galaxy observation history william herschel in meteorologica  aristotle  bc states that the greek philosophers anaxagoras  bc and democritus  bc proposed that the milky way is the glow of stars not directly visible due to earth shadow while other stars receive their light from the sun but have their glow obscured by solar rays.', 'aristotle himself believed that the milky way was part of the earth upper atmosphere along with the stars and that it was a byproduct of stars burning that did not dissipate because of its outermost location in the atmosphere composing its great circle .', 'the neoplatonist philosopher olympiodorus the younger   criticized this view arguing that if the milky way were sublunary  it should appear different at different times and places on earth and that it should have parallax  which it does not.', 'in his view the milky way is celestial.', 'this idea would be influential later in the islamic world .', 'the persian astronomer ab rayhn al-brn  proposed that the milky way is a collection of countless fragments of the nature of nebulous stars.', 'the andalusian astronomer avempace   proposed the milky way to be made up of many stars but appears to be a continuous image due to the effect of refraction in earth atmosphere citing his observation of a conjunction of jupiter and mars in or as evidence.', 'according to jamil ragep the persian astronomer nar al-dn al-s  in his writes the milky way i.e.', 'the galaxy is made up of a very large number of small tightly clustered stars which on account of their concentration and smallness seem to be cloudy patches.', 'because of this it was likened to milk in color.', 'ibn qayyim al-jawziyya  proposed that the milky way is a myriad of tiny stars packed together in the sphere of the fixed stars and that these stars are larger than planets.', 'proof of the milky way consisting of many stars came in when galileo galilei used a telescope to study the milky way and discovered that it is composed of a huge number of faint stars.', 'in a treatise in  immanuel kant  drawing on earlier work by thomas wright   speculated correctly that the milky way might be a rotating body of a huge number of stars held together by gravitational forces akin to the solar system but on much larger scales.', 'the resulting disk of stars would be seen as a band on the sky from our perspective inside the disk.', 'wright and kant also conjectured that some of the nebulae visible in the night sky might be separate galaxies themselves similar to our own.', 'kant referred to both the milky way and the extragalactic nebulae as island universes a term still current up to the .', 'the first attempt to describe the shape of the milky way and the position of the sun within it was carried out by william herschel in by carefully counting the number of stars in different regions of the visible sky.', 'he produced a diagram of the shape of the milky way with the solar system close to the center.', 'in  lord rosse constructed a new telescope and was able to distinguish between elliptical and spiral-shaped nebulae.', 'he also managed to make out individual point sources in some of these nebulae lending credence to kant earlier conjecture.', 'andromeda galaxy in  studying the proper motions of stars jacobus kapteyn reported that these were not random as

he was able to come up with a distance estimate of  parsecs.', 'he became a proponent of the island universes hypothesis which held that the spiral nebulae were independent galaxies.', 'in the great debate took place between harlow shapley and heber curtis concerning the nature of the milky way spiral nebulae and the dimensions of the universe.', 'to support his claim that the great andromeda nebula is an external galaxy curtis noted the appearance of dark lanes resembling the dust clouds in the milky way as well as the significant doppler shift .', 'the controversy was conclusively

natural satellite the moon and the natural satellites of the other planets on the one hand and artificial satellites on the other the term using natural in a sense opposed to artificial is used.', 'to further avoid ambiguity the convention is to capitalize the word moon when referring to earth natural satellite but not when referring to other natural satellites.', 'many authors define satellite or

philosophers using the idea of celestial spheres .', 'this model posited the existence of perfect moving spheres or rings to which the stars and planets were attached.', 'it assumed the heavens were fixed apart from the motion of the spheres and was developed without any understanding of gravity.', 'after the planets motions were more accurately measured theoretical mechanisms such as deferent and epicycles were added.', 'although the model was capable of reasonably accurately predicting the planets positions in the sky more and more epicycles were required as the measurements became more accurate hence the model became increasingly unwieldy.', 'originally geocentric  it was modified by copernicus to place the sun at the centre to help simplify the model.', 'the model was further challenged during the century as comets were observed traversing the spheres.', 'the basis for the modern understanding of orbits was first formulated by johannes kepler whose results are summarised in his three laws of planetary motion.', 'first he found that the orbits of the planets in our solar system are elliptical not circular or epicyclic  as had previously been believed and that the sun is not located at the center of the orbits but rather at one focus .', 'second he found that the orbital speed of each planet is not constant as had previously been thought but rather that the speed depends on the planet distance from the sun.', 'third kepler found a universal relationship between the orbital properties of all the planets orbiting the sun.', 'for the planets the cubes of their distances from the sun are proportional to the squares of their orbital periods.', 'jupiter and venus for example are respectively about .', 'and .', 'au distant from the sun their orbital periods respectively about .', 'and .', 'years.', 'the proportionality is seen by the fact that the ratio for jupiter .', '.', 'is practically equal to that for venus .', '.', 'in accord with the relationship.', 'idealised orbits meeting these rules are known as kepler orbits .', 'conic sections parabolic hyperbolic escape gravitational potential well isaac newton demonstrated that kepler laws were derivable from his theory of gravitation and that in general the orbits of bodies subject to gravity were conic sections this assumes that the force of gravity propagates instantaneously.', 'newton showed that for a pair of bodies the orbits sizes are in inverse proportion to their masses  and that those bodies orbit their common center of mass .', 'where one body is much more massive than the other as is the case of an artificial satellite orbiting a planet it is a convenient approximation to take the center of mass as coinciding with the center of the more massive body.', 'advances in newtonian mechanics were then used to explore variations from the simple assumptions behind kepler orbits such as the perturbations due to other bodies or the impact of spheroidal rather than spherical bodies.', 'lagrange  developed a new approach to newtonian mechanics emphasizing energy more than force and made progress on the three body problem  discovering the lagrangian points .', 'in a dramatic vindication of classical mechanics in urbain le verrier was able to predict the position of neptune based on unexplained perturbations in the orbit of uranus .', 'albert einstein - in his paper explained that gravity was due to curvature of space-time and removed newton assumption that changes propagate instantaneously.', 'this led astronomers to recognize that newtonian mechanics did not provide the highest accuracy in understanding orbits.', 'in relativity theory  orbits follow geodesic trajectories which are usually approximated very well by the newtonian predictions except where there are very strong gravity fields and very high speeds but the differences are measurable.', 'essentially all the experimental evidence that can distinguish between the theories agrees with relativity theory to within experimental measurement accuracy.', 'the original vindication of general relativity is that it was able to account for the remaining unexplained amount in precession of mercury perihelion first noted by le verrier.', 'however newton solution is still used for most short term purposes since it is significantly easier to use and sufficiently accurate.', 'edit needs additional citations for verification improve this article adding citations to reliable sources learn how and when to remove this template message within a planetary system  planets dwarf planets  asteroids and other minor planets  comets  and space debris orbit the system barycenter in elliptical orbits .', 'a comet in a parabolic or hyperbolic orbit about a barycenter is not gravitationally bound to the star and therefore is not considered part of the star planetary system.', 'bodies which are gravitationally bound to one of the planets in a planetary system either natural or artificial satellites  follow orbits about a barycenter near or within that planet.', 'owing to mutual gravitational perturbations  the eccentricities of the planetary orbits vary over time.', 'mercury  the smallest planet in the solar system has the most eccentric orbit.', 'at the present epoch  mars has the next largest eccentricity while the smallest orbital eccentricities are seen with venus and neptune .', 'as two objects orbit each other the periapsis is that point at which the two objects are closest to each other and the apoapsis is that point at which they are the farthest.', 'more specific terms are used for specific bodies.', 'for example and are the lowest and highest parts of an orbit around earth while and are the closest and farthest points of an orbit around the sun.', 'in the case of planets orbiting a star the mass of the star and all its satellites are calculated to be at a single point called the barycenter.', 'the paths of all the star satellites are elliptical orbits about that barycenter.', 'each satellite in that system will have its own elliptical orbit with the barycenter at one focal point of that ellipse.', 'at any point along its orbit any satellite will have a certain value of kinetic and potential energy with respect to the barycenter and that energy is a constant value at every point along its orbit.', 'as a result as a planet approaches periapsis  the planet will increase in speed as its potential energy decreases as a planet approaches apoapsis  its velocity will decrease as its potential energy increases.', 'edit there are a few common ways of understanding orbits tangential velocity as an illustration of an orbit around a planet the newton cannonball model may prove useful see image below.', 'this is a  thought experiment  in which a cannon on top of a tall mountain is able to fire a cannonball horizontally at any chosen muzzle speed.', 'the effects of air friction on the cannonball are ignored or perhaps the mountain is high enough that the cannon is above the earth atmosphere which is the same thing.', 'newton cannonball if the cannon fires its ball with a low initial speed the trajectory of the ball curves downward and hits the ground a. as the firing speed is increased the cannonball hits the ground farther b away from the cannon because while the ball is still falling towards the ground the ground is increasingly curving away from it see first point above.', 'all these motions are actually orbits in a technical sense they are describing a portion of an elliptical path around the center of gravity but the orbits are interrupted by striking the earth.', 'if the cannonball is fired with sufficient speed the ground curves away from the ball at least as much as the ball falls so the ball never strikes the ground.', 'it is now in what could be called a non-interrupted or circumnavigating orbit.', 'for any specific combination of height above the center of gravity and mass of the planet there is one specific firing speed unaffected by the mass of the ball which is assumed to be very small relative to the earth mass that produces a circular orbit  as shown in c. as the firing speed is increased beyond this non-interrupted elliptic orbits are produced one is shown in d. if the initial firing is above the surface of the earth as shown there will also be non-interrupted elliptical orbits at slower firing speed these will come closest to the earth at the point half an orbit beyond and directly opposite the firing point below the

cosmological theories category astronomy portal physical cosmology is a branch of cosmology concerned with the study of cosmological models.', 'a cosmological model  or simply cosmology  provides a description of the largest-scale structures and dynamics of the universe and allows study of fundamental questions about its origin structure evolution and ultimate fate.', 'cosmology as a science originated with the copernican principle  which implies that celestial bodies obey identical physical laws to those on earth and newtonian mechanics  which first allowed those physical laws to be understood.', 'physical cosmology as it is now understood began with the development in of albert einstein general theory of relativity  followed by major observational discoveries in the  first edwin hubble discovered that the universe contains a huge number of external galaxies beyond the milky way  then work by vesto slipher and others showed that the universe is expanding .', 'these advances made it possible to speculate about the origin of the universe  and allowed the establishment of the big bang theory by georges lematre  as the leading cosmological model.', 'a few researchers still advocate a handful of alternative cosmologies   however most cosmologists agree that the big bang theory best explains the observations.', 'dramatic advances in observational cosmology since the  including the cosmic microwave background  distant supernovae and galaxy redshift surveys  have led to the development of a standard model of cosmology .', 'this model requires the universe to contain large amounts of dark matter and dark energy whose nature is currently not well understood but the model gives detailed predictions that are in excellent agreement with many diverse observations.',

list of cosmologists modern cosmology developed along tandem tracks of theory and observation.', 'in  albert einstein published his theory of general relativity  which provided a unified description of gravity as a geometric property of space and time.', 'at the time einstein believed in a static universe  but found that his original formulation of the theory did not permit it.', 'this is because masses distributed throughout the universe gravitationally attract and move toward each other over time.', 'however he realized that his equations permitted the introduction of a constant term which could counteract the attractive force of gravity on the cosmic scale.', 'einstein published his first paper on relativistic cosmology in  in which he added this cosmological constant to his field equations in order to force them to model a static universe.', 'the einstein model describes a static universe space is finite and unbounded analogous to the surface of a sphere which has a finite area but no edges.', 'however this so-called einstein model is unstable to small perturbationsit will eventually start to expand or contract.', 'it was later realized that einstein model was just one of a larger set of possibilities all of which were consistent with general relativity and the cosmological principle.', 'the cosmological solutions of general relativity were found by alexander friedmann in the early .', 'his equations describe the friedmannlematrerobertsonwalker universe which may expand or contract and whose geometry may be open flat or closed.', 'universe gravitational waves cosmic inflation faster-than-light big bang    in the  vesto slipher and later carl wilhelm wirtz  interpreted the red shift of spiral nebulae as a doppler shift that indicated they were receding from earth.', 'however it is difficult to determine the distance to astronomical objects.', 'one way is to compare the physical size of an object to its angular size  but a physical size must be assumed to do this.', 'another method is to measure the brightness of an object and assume an intrinsic luminosity  from which the distance may be determined using the inverse-square law .', 'due to the difficulty of using these methods they did not realize that the nebulae were actually galaxies outside our own milky way  nor did they speculate about the cosmological implications.', 'in  the belgian roman catholic priest georges lematre independently derived the friedmannlematrerobertsonwalker equations and proposed on the basis of the recession of spiral nebulae that the universe began with the explosion of a primeval atom   which was later called the big bang .', 'in  edwin hubble provided an observational basis for lematre theory.', 'hubble showed that the spiral nebulae were galaxies by determining their distances using measurements of the brightness of cepheid variable stars.', 'he discovered a relationship between the redshift of a galaxy and its distance.', 'he interpreted this as evidence that the galaxies are receding from earth in every direction at speeds proportional to their distance.', 'this fact is now known as hubble law  though the numerical factor hubble found relating recessional velocity and distance was off by a factor of ten due to not knowing about the types of cepheid variables.', 'given the cosmological principle  hubble law suggested that the universe was expanding.', 'two primary explanations were proposed for the expansion.', 'one was lematre big bang theory advocated and developed by george gamow.', 'the other explanation was fred hoyle steady state model in which new matter is created as the galaxies move away from each other.', 'in this model the universe is roughly the same at any point in time.', 'for a number of years support for these theories was evenly divided.', 'however the observational evidence began to support the idea that the universe evolved from a hot dense state.', 'the discovery of the cosmic microwave background in lent strong support to the big bang model  and since the precise measurements of the cosmic microwave background by the cosmic background explorer in the early  few cosmologists have seriously proposed other theories of the origin and evolution of the cosmos.', 'one consequence of this is that in standard general relativity the universe began with a singularity  as demonstrated by roger penrose and stephen hawking in the .', 'an alternative view to extend the big bang model suggesting the universe had no beginning or singularity and the age of the universe is infinite has been presented.', 'edit the lightest chemical elements  primarily hydrogen and helium  were created during the big bang through the process of nucleosynthesis .', 'in a sequence of stellar nucleosynthesis reactions smaller atomic nuclei are then combined into larger atomic nuclei ultimately forming stable iron group elements such as iron and nickel  which have the highest nuclear binding energies .', 'the net process results in a  meaning subsequent to the big bang.', 'such reactions of nuclear particles can lead to from cataclysmic variable stars such as novae .', 'gravitational collapse of matter into black holes also powers the most energetic processes generally seen in the nuclear regions of galaxies forming quasars and active galaxies .', 'cosmologists cannot explain all cosmic phenomena exactly such as those related to the accelerating expansion of the universe  using conventional forms of energy .', 'instead cosmologists propose a new form of energy called dark energy that permeates all space.', 'one hypothesis is that dark energy is just the vacuum energy  a component of empty space that is associated with the virtual particles that exist due to the uncertainty principle .', 'there is no clear way to define the total energy in the universe using the most widely accepted theory of gravity general relativity .', 'therefore it remains controversial whether the total energy is conserved in an expanding universe.', 'for instance each photon that travels through intergalactic space loses energy due to the redshift effect.', 'this energy is not obviously transferred to any other system so seems to be permanently lost.', 'on the other hand some cosmologists insist that energy is conserved in some sense this follows the law of conservation of energy .', 'different forms of energy may dominate the cosmos relativistic particles which are referred to as radiation  or non-relativistic particles referred to as matter.', 'relativistic particles are particles whose rest mass is zero or negligible compared to their kinetic energy  and so move at the speed of light or very close to it non-relativistic particles have much higher rest mass than their energy and so move much slower than the speed of light.', 'as the universe expands both matter and radiation become diluted.', 'however the energy densities of radiation and matter dilute at different rates.', 'as a particular volume expands mass-energy density is changed only by the increase in volume but the energy density of radiation is changed both by the increase in volume and by the increase in the wavelength of the photons that make it up.', 'thus the energy of radiation becomes a smaller part of the universe total energy than that of matter as it expands.', 'the very early universe is said to have been dominated and radiation controlled the deceleration of expansion.', 'later as the average energy per photon becomes roughly ev and lower matter dictates the rate of deceleration and the universe is said to be dominated.', 'the intermediate case is not treated well analytically .', 'as the expansion of the universe continues matter dilutes even further and the cosmological constant becomes dominant leading to an acceleration in the universe expansion.', 'edit timeline of the big bang the history of the universe is a central issue in cosmology.', 'the history of the universe is divided into different periods called epochs according to the dominant forces and processes in each period.', 'the standard cosmological model is known as the lambda-cdm model .', 'edit friedmannlematrerobertsonwalker metric within the standard cosmological model  the equations of motion governing the universe as a whole are derived from general relativity with a small positive cosmological constant .', 'the solution is an expanding universe due to this expansion the radiation and matter in the universe cool down and become diluted.', 'at first the expansion is slowed down by gravitation attracting the radiation and matter in the universe.', 'however as these become diluted the cosmological constant becomes more dominant and the expansion of the universe starts to accelerate rather than decelerate.', 'in our universe this happened billions of years ago.', 'edit particle physics in cosmology during the earliest moments of the universe the average energy density was very high making knowledge of particle physics critical to understanding this environment.', 'hence scattering processes and decay of unstable elementary particles are important for cosmological models of this period.', 'as a rule of thumb a scattering or a decay process is cosmologically important in a certain epoch if the time scale describing that process is smaller than or comparable to the time scale of the expansion of the universe.', 'the time scale that describes the expansion of the universe is with being the hubble parameter  which varies with time.', 'the expansion timescale is roughly equal to the age of the universe at each point in time.', 'edit timeline of the big bang observations suggest that the universe began around .', 'billion years ago.', 'since then the evolution of the universe has passed through three phases.', 'the very early universe which is still poorly understood was the split second in which the universe was so hot that particles had energies higher than those currently accessible in particle accelerators on earth.', 'therefore while the basic features of this epoch have been worked out in the big bang theory the details are largely based on educated guesses.', 'following this in the early universe the evolution of the universe proceeded according to known high energy physics .', 'this is when the first protons electrons and neutrons formed then nuclei and finally atoms.', 'with the formation of neutral hydrogen the cosmic microwave background was emitted.', 'finally the epoch of structure formation began when matter started to aggregate into the first stars and quasars  and ultimately galaxies clusters of galaxies and superclusters formed.', 'the future of the universe is not yet firmly known but according to the cdm model it will continue expanding forever.', 'edit below some of the most active areas of inquiry in cosmology are described in roughly chronological order.', 'this does not include all of the big bang cosmology which is presented in timeline of the big bang edit the early hot universe appears to be well explained by the big bang from roughly seconds onwards but there are several problems .', 'one is that there is no compelling reason using current particle physics for the universe to be flat  homogeneous and isotropic cosmological principle .', 'moreover grand unified theories of particle physics suggest that there should be magnetic monopoles in the universe which have not been found.', 'these problems are resolved by a brief period of cosmic inflation  which drives the universe to flatness  smooths out anisotropies and inhomogeneities to the observed level and exponentially dilutes the monopoles.', 'the physical model behind cosmic inflation is extremely simple but it has not yet been confirmed by particle physics and there are difficult problems reconciling inflation and quantum field theory .', 'some cosmologists think that string theory and brane cosmology will provide an alternative to inflation.', 'another major problem in cosmology is what caused the universe to contain far more matter than antimatter .', 'cosmologists can observationally deduce that the universe is not split into regions of matter and antimatter.', 'if it were there would be x-rays and gamma rays produced as a result of annihilation  but this is not observed.', 'therefore some process in the early universe must have created a small excess of matter over antimatter and this currently not understood process is called baryogenesis .', 'three required conditions for baryogenesis were derived by andrei sakharov in  and requires a violation of the particle physics symmetry  called cp-symmetry  between matter and antimatter.', 'however particle accelerators measure too small a violation of cp-symmetry to account for the baryon asymmetry.', 'cosmologists and particle physicists look for additional violations of the cp-symmetry in the early universe that might account for the baryon asymmetry.', 'both the problems of baryogenesis and cosmic inflation are very closely related to particle physics and their resolution might come from high energy theory and experiment  rather than through observations of the universe.', 'edit big bang nucleosynthesis big bang nucleosynthesis is the theory of the formation of the elements in the early universe.', 'it finished when the universe was about three minutes old and its temperature dropped below that at which nuclear fusion could occur.', 'big bang nucleosynthesis had a brief period during which it could operate so only the very lightest elements were produced.', 'starting from hydrogen ions  protons  it principally produced deuterium  helium-  and lithium .', 'other elements were produced in only trace abundances.', 'the basic theory of nucleosynthesis was developed in by george gamow  ralph asher alpher  and robert herman .', 'it was used for many years as a probe of physics at the time of the big bang as the theory of big bang nucleosynthesis connects the abundances of primordial light elements with the features of the early universe.', 'specifically it can be used to test the equivalence principle   to probe dark matter  and test neutrino physics.', 'some cosmologists have proposed that big bang nucleosynthesis suggests there is a fourth sterile species of neutrino.', 'edit the cdm  lambda cold dark matter  or lambda-cdm model is a parametrization of the big bang cosmological model in which the universe contains a cosmological constant  denoted by lambda  greek  associated with dark energy  and cold dark matter abbreviated cdm .', 'it is frequently referred to as the standard model of big bang cosmology.', 'edit cosmic microwave background the cosmic microwave background is radiation left over from decoupling after the epoch of recombination when neutral atoms first formed.', 'at this point radiation produced in the big bang stopped thomson scattering from charged ions.', 'the radiation first observed in by arno penzias and robert woodrow wilson  has a perfect thermal black-body spectrum.', 'it has a temperature of .', 'kelvins today and is isotropic to one part in .', 'cosmological perturbation theory  which describes the evolution of slight inhomogeneities in the early universe has allowed cosmologists to precisely calculate the angular power spectrum of the radiation and it has been measured by the recent satellite experiments  cobe and wmap   and many ground and balloon-based experiments such as degree angular scale interferometer  cosmic background imager  and boomerang .', 'one of the goals of these efforts is to measure the basic parameters of the lambda-cdm model with increasing accuracy as well as to test the predictions of the big bang model and look for new physics.', 'the results of measurements made by wmap for example have placed limits on the neutrino masses.', 'newer experiments such as quiet and the atacama cosmology telescope  are trying to measure the polarization of the cosmic microwave background.', 'these measurements are expected to provide further confirmation of the theory as well as information about cosmic inflation and the so-called secondary anisotropies  such as the sunyaev-zel effect and sachs-wolfe effect  which are caused by interaction between galaxies and clusters with the cosmic microwave background.', 'on march  astronomers of the collaboration announced the apparent detection of -mode polarization of the cmb considered to be evidence of primordial gravitational waves that are predicted by the theory of inflation to occur during the earliest phase of the big bang .', 'however later that year the planck collaboration provided a more accurate measurement of cosmic dust  concluding that the b-mode signal from dust is the same strength as that reported from .', 'on january  a joint analysis of and planck data was published and the european space agency announced that the signal can be entirely attributed to interstellar dust in the milky way.', 'edit large-scale structure of the cosmos structure formation galaxy formation and evolution understanding the formation and evolution of the largest and earliest structures i.e.', 'quasars  galaxies  clusters and superclusters  is one of the largest efforts in cosmology.', 'cosmologists study a model of hierarchical structure formation in which structures form from the bottom up with smaller objects forming first while the largest objects such as superclusters are still assembling.', 'one way to study structure in the universe is to survey the visible galaxies in order to construct a three-dimensional picture of the galaxies in the universe and measure the matter power spectrum .', 'this is the approach of the sloan digital sky survey and the galaxy redshift survey .', 'another tool for understanding structure formation is simulations which cosmologists use to study the gravitational aggregation of matter in the universe as it clusters into filaments  superclusters and voids .', 'most simulations contain only non-baryonic cold dark matter  which should suffice to understand the universe on the largest scales as there is much more dark matter in the universe than visible baryonic matter.', 'more advanced simulations are starting to include baryons and study the formation of individual galaxies.', 'cosmologists study these simulations to see if they agree with the galaxy surveys and to understand any discrepancy.', 'other complementary observations to measure the distribution of matter in the distant universe and to probe reionization include lyman-alpha forest  absorption  weak lensing gravitational lensing  these will help cosmologists settle the question of when and how structure formed in the universe.', 'edit dark matter evidence from big bang nucleosynthesis  the cosmic microwave background  structure formation and galaxy rotation curves suggests that about  of the mass of the universe consists of non-baryonic dark matter whereas only  consists of visible baryonic matter .', 'the gravitational effects of dark matter are well understood as it behaves like a cold non-radiative fluid that forms haloes around galaxies.', 'dark matter has never been detected in the laboratory and the particle physics nature of dark matter remains completely unknown.', 'without observational constraints there are a number of candidates such as a stable supersymmetric particle a weakly interacting massive particle  a gravitationally-interacting massive particle  an axion  and a massive compact halo object .', 'alternatives to the dark matter hypothesis include a modification of gravity at small accelerations  mond  or an effect from brane cosmology .', 'edit dark energy if the universe is flat  there must be an additional component making up  in addition to the  dark matter and  baryons of the energy density of the universe.', 'this is called dark energy.', 'in order not to interfere with big bang nucleosynthesis and the cosmic microwave background it must not cluster in haloes like baryons and dark matter.', 'there is strong observational evidence for dark energy as the total energy density of the universe is known through constraints on the flatness of the universe but the amount of clustering matter is tightly measured and is much less than this.', 'the case for dark energy was strengthened in  when measurements demonstrated that the expansion of the universe has begun to gradually accelerate.', 'apart from its density and its clustering properties nothing is known about dark energy.', 'quantum field theory predicts a cosmological constant cc much like dark energy but orders of magnitude larger than that observed.', 'steven weinberg and a number of string theorists string landscape have invoked the anthropic principle  i.e.', 'the reason that physicists observe a universe with such a small cosmological constant is that no physicists or any life could exist in a universe with a larger cosmological constant.', 'many cosmologists find this an unsatisfying explanation perhaps because while the weak anthropic principle is self-evident given that living observers exist there must be at least one universe with a cosmological constant which allows for life to exist it does not attempt to explain the context of that universe.', 'for example the weak anthropic principle alone does not distinguish between other possible explanations for dark energy include quintessence  or a modification of gravity on the largest scales.', 'the effect on cosmology of the dark energy that these models describe is given by the dark energy equation of state  which varies depending upon the theory.', 'the nature of dark energy is one of the most challenging problems in cosmology.', 'a better understanding of dark energy is likely to solve the problem of the ultimate fate of the universe .', 'in the current cosmological epoch the accelerated expansion due to dark energy is preventing structures larger than superclusters from forming.', 'it is not known whether the acceleration will continue indefinitely perhaps even increasing until a big rip  or whether it will eventually reverse lead to a big freeze  or follow some other scenario.',

source.', 'gravitational-wave astronomy is an emerging branch of observational astronomy which aims to use gravitational waves to collect observational data about sources of detectable gravitational

kepler-  with a mass and radius slightly higher than that of the moon .', 'planetary differentiation every planet began its existence in an entirely fluid state in early formation the denser heavier materials sank to the centre leaving the lighter materials near the surface.', 'each therefore has a differentiated interior consisting of a dense planetary core surrounded by a mantle that either is or was a fluid .', 'the terrestrial planets are sealed within hard crusts   but in the giant planets the mantle simply blends into the upper cloud layers.', 'the terrestrial planets have cores of elements such as iron and nickel  and mantles of silicates .', 'jupiter and saturn are believed to have cores of rock and metal surrounded by mantles of metallic hydrogen .', 'uranus and neptune  which are smaller have rocky cores surrounded by mantles of water  ammonia  methane and other ices .', 'the fluid action within these planets cores creates a geodynamo that generates a magnetic field .', 'atmosphere extraterrestrial atmospheres extraterrestrial skies all of the solar system planets except mercury  have substantial atmospheres because their gravity is strong enough to keep gases close to the surface.', 'the larger giant planets are massive enough to keep large amounts of the light gases hydrogen and helium  whereas the smaller planets lose these gases into space .', 'the composition of earth atmosphere is different from the other planets because the various life processes that have transpired on the planet have introduced free molecular oxygen .', 'planetary atmospheres are affected by the varying insolation or internal energy leading to the formation of dynamic weather systems such as hurricanes  on earth planet-wide dust storms on mars a greater-than-earth-sized anticyclone on jupiter called the great red spot  and holes in the atmosphere on neptune.', 'at least one extrasolar planet hd b  has been claimed to have such a weather system similar to the great red spot but twice as large.', 'hot jupiters due to their extreme proximities to their host stars have been shown to be losing their atmospheres into space due to stellar radiation much like the tails of comets.', 'these planets may have vast differences in temperature between their day and night sides that produce supersonic winds  although the day and night sides of hd b appear to have very similar temperatures indicating that that planet atmosphere effectively redistributes the star energy around the planet.', 'magnetosphere earth magnetosphere one important characteristic of the planets is their intrinsic magnetic moments  which in turn give rise to magnetospheres.', 'the presence of a magnetic field indicates that the planet is still geologically alive.', 'in other words magnetized planets have flows of electrically conducting material in their interiors which generate their magnetic fields.', 'these fields significantly change the interaction of the planet and solar wind.', 'a magnetized planet creates a cavity in the solar wind around itself called the magnetosphere which the wind cannot penetrate.', 'the magnetosphere can be much larger than the planet itself.', 'in contrast non-magnetized planets have only small magnetospheres induced by interaction of the ionosphere with the solar wind which cannot effectively protect the planet.', 'of the eight planets in the solar system only venus and mars lack such a magnetic field.', 'in addition the moon of jupiter ganymede also has one.', 'of the magnetized planets the magnetic field of mercury is the weakest and is barely able to deflect the solar wind .', 'ganymede magnetic field is several times larger and jupiter is the strongest in the solar system so strong in fact that it poses a serious health risk to future manned missions to its moons.', 'the magnetic fields of the other giant planets are roughly similar in strength to that of earth but their magnetic moments are significantly larger.', 'the magnetic fields of uranus and neptune are strongly tilted relative the rotational axis and displaced from the centre of the planet.', 'in  a team of astronomers in hawaii observed an extrasolar planet around the star hd  which appeared to be creating a sunspot on the surface of its parent star.', 'the team hypothesized that the planet magnetosphere was transferring energy onto the star surface increasing its already high  temperature by an additional .', 'natural satellite planetary ring rings of saturn several planets or dwarf planets in the solar system such as neptune and pluto have orbital periods that are in resonance with each other or with smaller bodies this is also common in satellite systems.', 'all except mercury and venus have natural satellites  often called moons.', 'earth has one mars has two and the giant planets have numerous moons in complex planetary-type systems.', 'many moons of the giant planets have features similar to those on the terrestrial planets and dwarf planets and some have been studied as possible abodes of life especially europa .', 'the four giant planets are also orbited by planetary rings of varying size and complexity.', 'the rings are composed primarily of dust or particulate matter but can host tiny  moonlets  whose gravity shapes and maintains their structure.', 'although the origins of planetary rings is not precisely known they are believed to be the result of natural satellites that fell below their parent planet roche limit and were torn apart by tidal forces .', 'no secondary characteristics have been observed around extrasolar planets.', 'the sub-brown dwarf cha -  which has been described as a rogue planet  is believed to be orbited by a tiny protoplanetary disc  and the

composed primarily of hydrogen along with helium and trace amounts of heavier elements.', 'the total mass of a star is the main factor that determines its evolution and eventual fate.', 'for most of its active life  a star shines due to thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium in its core releasing energy that traverses the star interior and then radiates into outer space .', 'at the end of a star lifetime its core becomes a stellar remnant  a white dwarf  a neutron star  or if it is sufficiently massive a black hole .', 'almost all naturally occurring elements heavier than lithium are

stars  whose position on the celestial sphere does not change and wandering stars  planets  which move noticeably relative to the fixed stars over days or weeks.', 'many ancient astronomers believed that the stars were permanently affixed to a heavenly sphere and that they were immutable.', 'by convention astronomers grouped prominent stars into asterisms and constellations and used them to track the motions of the planets and the inferred position of the sun.', 'the motion of the sun against the background stars and the horizon was used to create calendars  which could be used to regulate

greek plants meaning wanderer represented various important deities from which the names of the planets mercury  venus  mars  jupiter and saturn were taken.', 'uranus and neptune were greek and roman gods  but neither planet was known in antiquity because of their low brightness.', 'their names were assigned by later astronomers.', 'circa  the names of the constellations were used to name the stars in the corresponding regions of the sky.', 'the german astronomer johann bayer created a series of star maps and applied greek letters as designations to the stars in each constellation.', 'later a numbering system based on the star right ascension was invented and added to john flamsteed star catalogue in his book the edition whereby this numbering system came to be called flamsteed

group on star names wgsn  which catalogs and standardizes proper names for stars.', 'a number of private companies sell names of stars which are not recognized by the iau professional astronomers or the amateur astronomy community.', 'the british library calls this an unregulated commercial enterprise    and the new york city department of consumer and worker protection issued a violation against one such star-naming company for engaging in a deceptive trade practice.', 'although stellar parameters can be expressed in si units or gaussian units  it is often most convenient to express mass  luminosity  and radii in solar units based on the characteristics of the sun.', 'in  the iau defined a set of solar values defined as si constants without uncertainties which can be used for quoting stellar parameters nominal solar luminosity  nominal solar radius  the solar mass m was not explicitly defined by the iau due to the large relative uncertainty   of the newtonian gravitational constant g. since the product of the newtonian gravitational constant and solar mass\\ntogether gm  has been determined to much greater precision the iau defined the solar mass parameter to be  the nominal solar mass parameter can be combined with the most recent  codata estimate of the newtonian gravitational constant g to derive the solar mass to be approximately .', 'kg.', 'although the exact values for the luminosity radius mass parameter and mass may vary slightly in the future due to observational uncertainties the iau nominal constants will remain the same si values as they remain useful measures for quoting stellar parameters.', 'large lengths such as the radius of a giant star or the semi-major axis of a binary star system are often expressed in terms of the astronomical unit approximately equal to the mean distance between the earth and the sun  km or approximately miles.', 'in  the iau defined the astronomical constant to be an exact length in meters  m.  stellar evolution stars condense from regions of space of higher matter density yet those regions are less dense than within a vacuum chamber .', 'these regionsknown as molecular clouds consist mostly of hydrogen with about to percent helium and a few percent heavier elements.', 'one example of such a star-forming region is the orion nebula .', 'most stars form in groups of dozens to hundreds of thousands of stars.', 'massive stars in these groups may powerfully illuminate those clouds ionizing the hydrogen and creating h ii regions .', 'such feedback effects from star formation may ultimately disrupt the cloud and prevent further star formation.', 'all stars spend the majority of their existence as main sequence  fueled primarily by the nuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium within their cores.', 'however stars of different masses have markedly different properties at various stages of their development.', 'the ultimate fate of more massive stars differs from that of less massive stars as do their luminosities and the impact they have on their environment.', 'accordingly astronomers often group stars by their mass  helium red giants helium white dwarfs  age of the

supernovae are produced remains unclear.', 'despite this uncertainty in how type ia supernovae are produced type ia supernovae have very uniform properties and are useful standard candles over intergalactic distances.', 'some calibrations are required to compensate for the gradual change in properties or different frequencies of abnormal luminosity supernovae at high redshift and for small

nucleation self-assembly self-organization order and disorder category in physics  energy is the quantitative property that must be transferred to a body or physical system to perform work on the body or to heat it.', 'energy is a conserved quantity  the law of conservation of energy states that energy can be converted in form but not created or destroyed.', 'the unit of measurement in the international system of units si of energy is the joule  which is the energy transferred to an object by the work of moving it a distance of one metre against a force of one newton .', 'common forms of energy include the kinetic energy of a moving object the potential energy stored by an object position in a force field  gravitational  electric or magnetic  the elastic energy stored by stretching solid objects the chemical energy released when a fuel burns  the radiant energy carried by light and the thermal energy due to an object temperature .', 'mass and energy are closely related.', 'due to massenergy equivalence  any object that has mass when stationary called rest mass  also has an equivalent amount of energy whose form is called rest energy  and any additional energy of any form acquired by the object above that rest energy will increase the object total mass just as it increases its total energy.', 'for example after heating an object its increase in energy could be measured as a small increase in mass with a sensitive enough scale .', 'living organisms require energy to stay alive such as the energy humans get from food .', 'human civilization requires energy to function which it gets from energy resources such as fossil fuels  nuclear fuel  or renewable energy .', 'the processes of earth climate and ecosystem are driven by the radiant energy earth receives from the sun and the geothermal energy contained within the earth.', 'contents needs additional citations for verification improve this article adding citations to reliable sources learn how and when to remove this template message lightning megajoules electric potential energy light energy sound energy thermal energy thermal energy kinetic potential energy the total energy of a system can be subdivided and classified into potential energy kinetic energy or combinations of the two in various ways.', 'kinetic energy is determined by the movement of an object or the composite motion of the components of an object and potential energy reflects the potential of an object to have motion and generally is a function of the position of an object within a field or may be stored in the field itself.', 'while these two categories are sufficient to describe all forms of energy it is often convenient to refer to particular combinations of potential and kinetic energy as its own form.', 'for example macroscopic mechanical energy is the sum of translational and rotational kinetic and potential energy in a system neglects the kinetic energy due to temperature and nuclear energy which combines potentials from the nuclear force and the weak force  among others.', 'mechanical macroscopic electric magnetic gravitational chemical ionization binds nuclear binds nucleons atomic nucleus

thermodynamics statistical mechanics and random processes thomas young the word derives from the ancient greek   romanized energeia  lit.', 'operation  which possibly appears for the first time in the work of aristotle in the century bc.', 'in contrast to the modern definition energeia was a qualitative philosophical concept broad enough to include ideas such as happiness and pleasure.', 'in the late century gottfried leibniz proposed the idea of the latin  vis viva  or living force which defined as the product of the mass of an object and its velocity squared he believed that total was conserved.', 'to account for slowing due to friction leibniz theorized that thermal energy consisted of the motions of the constituent parts of matter although it would be more than a century until this was generally accepted.', 'the modern analog of this property kinetic energy  differs from only by a factor of two.', 'writing in the early century milie du chtelet proposed the concept of conservation of energy in the marginalia of her french language translation of newton principia mathematica  which represented the first formulation of a conserved measurable quantity that was distinct from momentum  and which would later be called energy.', 'in  thomas young was possibly the first to use the term energy instead of  in its modern sense.', 'gustave-gaspard coriolis described  kinetic energy  in in its modern sense and in  william rankine coined the term  potential energy .', 'the law of conservation of energy was also first postulated in the early century and applies to any isolated system .', 'it was argued for some years whether heat was a physical substance dubbed the caloric  or merely a physical quantity such as momentum .', 'in james prescott joule discovered the link between mechanical work and the generation of heat.', 'these developments led to the theory of conservation of energy formalized largely by william thomson  lord kelvin  as the field of thermodynamics .', 'thermodynamics aided the rapid development of explanations of chemical processes by rudolf clausius  josiah willard gibbs  and walther nernst .', 'it also led to a mathematical formulation of the concept of entropy by clausius and to the introduction of laws of radiant energy by joef stefan .', 'according to noether theorem  the conservation of energy is a consequence of the fact that the laws of physics do not change over time.', 'thus since  theorists have understood that the law of conservation of energy is the direct mathematical consequence of the translational symmetry of the quantity conjugate to energy namely time.', 'units of energy in  james prescott joule independently discovered the mechanical equivalent in a series of experiments.', 'the most famous of them used the joule apparatus a descending weight attached to a string caused rotation of a paddle immersed in water practically insulated from heat transfer.', 'it showed that the gravitational potential energy lost by the weight in descending was equal to the internal energy gained by the water through friction with the paddle.', 'in the international system of units si the unit of energy is the joule named after joule.', 'it is a derived unit .', 'it is equal to the energy expended or work done in applying a force of one newton through a distance of one metre.', 'however energy is also expressed in many other units not part of the si such as ergs  calories  british thermal units  kilowatt-hours and kilocalories  which require a conversion factor when expressed in si units.', 'the si unit of energy rate energy per unit time is the watt  which is a joule per second.', 'thus one joule is one watt-second and joules equal one watt-hour.', 'the cgs energy unit is the erg and the imperial and us customary unit is the foot pound .', 'other energy units such as the electronvolt  food calorie or thermodynamic kcal based on the temperature change of water in a heating process

the mechanical work article.', 'work and thus energy is frame dependent .', 'for example consider a ball being hit by a bat.', 'in the center-of-mass reference frame the bat does no work on the ball.', 'but in the reference frame of the person swinging the bat considerable work is done on the ball.', 'the total energy of a system is sometimes called the hamiltonian  after william rowan hamilton .', 'the classical equations of motion can be written in terms of the hamiltonian even for highly complex or abstract systems.', 'these classical equations have remarkably direct analogs in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics.', 'another energy-related concept is called the lagrangian  after joseph-louis lagrange .', 'this formalism is as fundamental as the hamiltonian and both can be used to derive the equations of motion or be derived from them.', 'it was invented in the context of classical mechanics  but is generally useful in modern physics.', 'the lagrangian is defined as the kinetic energy the potential energy.', 'usually the lagrange formalism is mathematically more convenient than the hamiltonian for non-conservative systems such as systems with friction.', 'noether

their minds like this as well.', 'this linguistic evidence that abstract concepts are based in spatial concepts also reveals that the way humans mentally organize time events varies across culturesthat is a certain specific mental organization system is not universal.', 'so although western cultures typically associate past events with the left and future events with the right according to a certain mtl this kind of horizontal egocentric mtl is not the spatial organization of all cultures.', 'although most developed nations use an egocentric spatial system there is recent evidence that some cultures use an allocentric spatialization often based on environmental features.', 'a recent study of the indigenous yupno people of papua new guinea focused on the directional gestures used when individuals used time-related words.', 'when speaking of the past such as last year or past times individuals gestured downhill where the river of the valley flowed into the ocean.', 'when speaking of the future they gestured uphill toward the source of the river.', 'this was common regardless of which direction the person faced revealing that the yupno people may use an allocentric mtl in which time flows uphill.', 'a similar study of the pormpuraawans an aboriginal group in australia revealed a similar distinction in which when asked to organize photos of a man aging in order individuals consistently placed the youngest photos to the east and the oldest photos to the west regardless of which direction they faced.', 'this directly clashed with an american group that consistently organized the photos from left to right.', 'therefore this group also appears to have an allocentric mtl but based on the cardinal directions instead of geographical features.', 'the wide

its natural course of free fall  which can be influenced by the nearby gravitational field.', 'no matter how strong the gravitational field objects in free fall are weightless  though they still have mass.', 'the force known as weight is proportional to mass and acceleration in all situations where the mass is accelerated away from free fall.', 'for example when a body is at rest in a gravitational field rather than in free fall it must be accelerated by a force from a scale or the surface of a planetary body such as the earth or the moon .', 'this force keeps the object from going

to mechanical accelerations from forces other than the resistance of a planetary surface the weight force is proportional to the mass of an object multiplied by the total acceleration away from free fall which is called the proper acceleration .', 'through such mechanisms objects in elevators vehicles centrifuges and the like may experience weight forces many times those caused by resistance to the effects of gravity on objects resulting from planetary surfaces.', 'in such cases the generalized equation for weight of an object is related to its mass by the equation  where is the proper acceleration of the object caused by all influences other than gravity.', 'again if gravity is the only influence such as occurs when an object falls freely its weight will be zero.', 'although inertial mass passive gravitational mass and active gravitational mass are conceptually distinct no experiment has ever unambiguously demonstrated any difference between them.', 'in classical mechanics  newton third law implies that active and passive gravitational mass must always be identical or at least proportional but the classical theory offers no compelling reason why the

friction and air resistance  must be absent or at least negligible.', 'for example if a hammer and a feather are dropped from the same height through the air on earth the feather will take much longer to reach the ground the feather is not really in -fall because the force of air resistance upwards against the feather is comparable to the downward force of gravity.', 'on the other hand if the experiment is performed in a vacuum  in which there is no air resistance the hammer and the feather should hit the ground at exactly the same time assuming the acceleration of both objects towards each other and of the ground towards both objects for its own part is negligible.', 'this can easily be done in a high school laboratory by dropping the objects in transparent tubes that have the air removed with a vacuum pump.', 'it is even more dramatic when done in an environment that naturally has a vacuum as david scott did on the surface of the moon during apollo .', 'a stronger version of

is impossible to distinguish between a uniform acceleration and a uniform gravitational field.', 'thus the theory postulates that the force acting on a massive object caused by a gravitational field is a result of the object tendency to move in a straight line in other words its inertia and should therefore be a function of its inertial mass and the strength of the gravitational field.', 'mass generation mechanism in theoretical physics  a mass generation mechanism is a theory which attempts to explain the origin of mass from the most fundamental laws of physics .', 'to date a number of different models have been proposed which advocate different views of the origin of mass.', 'the problem is complicated by the fact that the notion of mass is strongly related to the gravitational

the number of objects in the collection where is the weight of the collection of similar objects and is the number of objects in the collection.', 'proportionality by definition implies that two values have a constant ratio  an early use of this relationship is a balance scale  which balances the force of one object weight against the force of another object weight.', 'the two sides of a balance scale are close enough that the objects experience similar gravitational fields.', 'hence if they have similar masses then their weights will also be similar.', 'this allows the scale by comparing weights to also compare masses.', 'consequently historical weight standards were often defined in terms of amounts.', 'the romans for example used the carob seed  carat or siliqua  as a measurement standard.', 'if an object weight was equivalent to carob seeds  then the object was said to weigh one roman pound.', 'if on the other hand the object weight was equivalent to carob seeds

four objects later named the galilean moons in honor of their discoverer were the first celestial bodies observed to orbit something other than the earth or sun.', 'galileo continued to observe these moons over the next eighteen months and by the middle of  he had obtained remarkably accurate estimates for their periods.', 'sometime prior to  galileo turned his attention to the phenomenon of objects in free fall attempting to characterize these motions.', 'galileo was not the first to investigate earth gravitational field nor was he the first to accurately describe its fundamental characteristics.', 'however galileo reliance on scientific experimentation to establish physical principles would have a profound effect on future generations of scientists.', 'it is unclear if these were just hypothetical experiments used to illustrate a concept or if they were real experiments performed by galileo  but the results obtained from these experiments were both realistic and compelling.', 'a biography by galileo pupil vincenzo viviani stated that galileo had dropped balls of the same material but different masses from the leaning tower of pisa to demonstrate that their time of descent was independent of their mass.', 'note  in support of this conclusion galileo had advanced the following theoretical argument he asked if two bodies of different masses and different rates of fall are tied by a string does the combined system fall faster because it is now more massive or does the lighter body in its slower fall hold back the heavier body the only convincing resolution to this question is that all bodies must fall at the same rate.', 'a later experiment was described in galileo published in .', 'one of galileo fictional characters salviati describes an

enough so that the elapsed time could be measured.', 'the ball was allowed to roll a known distance down the ramp and the time taken for the ball to move the known distance was measured.', 'the time was measured using a water clock described as follows  galileo found that for an object in free fall the distance that the object has fallen is always proportional to the square of the elapsed time galileo had shown that objects in free fall under the influence of the earth gravitational field have a constant acceleration and galileo contemporary johannes kepler had shown that the planets follow elliptical paths under the influence of the sun gravitational mass.', 'however galileo free fall motions and kepler planetary motions remained distinct during galileo lifetime.', 'semi-major axis sidereal orbital period au sidereal year robert hooke had published his concept of gravitational forces in  stating that all celestial bodies have an attraction or gravitating power towards their own centers and also attract all the other celestial bodies that are within the sphere of their activity.', 'he further stated that gravitational attraction increases by how much nearer the body wrought upon is to its own center.', 'in correspondence with isaac newton from and  hooke conjectured that gravitational forces might decrease according to the double of the distance between the two bodies.', 'hooke urged newton who was a pioneer in the development of calculus  to work through the mathematical details of keplerian orbits to determine if hooke hypothesis was correct.', 'newton own investigations verified that hooke was correct but due to personal differences between the two men newton chose not to reveal this to hooke.', 'isaac newton kept quiet about his discoveries until  at which time he told a friend edmond halley  that he had solved the problem of gravitational orbits but had misplaced the solution in his office.', 'after being encouraged by halley newton decided to develop his ideas about gravity and publish all of his findings.', 'in november  isaac newton sent a document to edmund halley now lost but presumed to have been titled de motu corporum in gyrum latin for on the motion of bodies in an orbit.', 'halley presented newton findings to the royal society of london with a promise that a fuller presentation would follow.', 'newton later recorded his ideas in a three-book set entitled philosophi naturalis principia mathematica latin .', 'the first was received by the royal society on april  the second on march  and the third on april .', 'the royal society published newton entire collection at their own expense in may .', 'isaac newton had bridged the gap between kepler gravitational mass and galileo gravitational acceleration resulting in the discovery of the following relationship which governed both of these where g is the apparent acceleration of a body as it passes through a region of space where gravitational fields exist is the gravitational mass  standard gravitational parameter  of the body causing gravitational fields and r is the radial coordinate the distance between the centers of the two bodies.', 'by finding the exact relationship between a body gravitational mass and its gravitational field newton provided a second method for measuring gravitational mass.', 'the mass of the earth can be determined using kepler method from the orbit of earth moon or it can be determined by measuring the gravitational acceleration on the earth surface and multiplying that by the square of the earth radius.', 'the mass of the earth is approximately three-millionths of the mass of the sun.', 'to date no other accurate method for measuring gravitational mass has been discovered.', 'intermediate speeds escape velocity newton cannonball newton cannonball was a thought experiment used to bridge the gap between galileo gravitational acceleration and kepler elliptical orbits.', 'it appeared in newton book .', 'according to galileo concept of gravitation a dropped stone falls with constant acceleration down towards the earth.', 'however newton explains that when a stone is thrown horizontally meaning sideways or perpendicular to earth gravity it follows a curved path.', 'for a stone projected is by the pressure of its own weight forced out of the rectilinear path which by the projection alone it should have pursued and made to describe a curve line in the air and through that crooked way is at last brought down to the ground.', 'and the greater the velocity is with which it is projected the farther it goes before it falls to the earth.', 'newton further reasons that if an object were projected in an horizontal direction from the top of a high mountain with sufficient velocity it would reach at last quite beyond the circumference of the earth and return to the mountain from which it was projected.', 'in contrast to earlier theories e.g.', 'celestial spheres  which stated that the heavens were made of entirely different material newton theory of mass was groundbreaking partly because it introduced universal gravitational mass  every object has gravitational mass and therefore every object generates a gravitational field.', 'newton further assumed that the strength of each object gravitational field would decrease according to the square of the distance to that object.', 'if a large collection of small objects were formed into a giant spherical body such as the earth or sun newton calculated the collection would create a gravitational field proportional to the total mass of the body  and inversely proportional to the square of the distance to the body center.', 'note  for example according to newton theory of universal gravitation each carob seed produces a gravitational field.', 'therefore if one were to gather an immense number of carob seeds and form them into an enormous sphere then the gravitational field of the sphere would be proportional to the number of carob seeds in the sphere.', 'hence it should be theoretically possible to determine the exact number of carob seeds that would be required to produce a gravitational field similar to that of the earth or sun.', 'in fact by unit conversion it is a simple matter of abstraction to realize that any traditional mass unit can theoretically be used to measure gravitational mass.', 'measuring gravitational mass in terms of traditional mass units is simple in principle but extremely difficult in practice.', 'according to newton theory all objects produce gravitational fields and it is theoretically possible to collect an immense number of small objects and form them into an enormous gravitating sphere.', 'however from a practical standpoint the gravitational fields of small objects are extremely weak and difficult to measure.', 'newton books on universal gravitation were published in the  but the first successful measurement of the earth mass in terms of traditional mass units

weighing .', 'in simple spring scales  for example the force is proportional to the displacement of the spring beneath the weighing pan as per hooke law  and the scales are calibrated to take into account allowing the mass to be read off.', 'assuming the gravitational field is equivalent on both sides of the balance a balance measures relative weight giving the relative gravitation mass of each

means.', 'this equation illustrates how mass relates to the inertia of a body.', 'consider two objects with different masses.', 'if we apply an identical force to each the object with a bigger mass will experience a smaller acceleration and the object with a smaller mass will experience a bigger acceleration.', 'we might say that the larger mass exerts a greater resistance to changing its state of motion in response to the force.', 'however this notion of applying identical forces to different objects brings us back to the fact that we have not really defined what a force is.', 'we can sidestep this difficulty with the help of newton third law  which states that if one object exerts a force on a second object it will experience an equal and opposite force.', 'to be precise suppose we have two objects of constant inertial masses and .', 'we isolate the two objects from all other physical influences so that the only forces present are the force exerted on by  which we denote f

any other object in the universe by colliding it with the reference object and measuring the accelerations.', 'additionally mass relates a body momentum p to its linear velocity v  and the body

and the forces acting on it.', 'the first law states that an object either remains at rest or continues to move at a constant velocity  unless it is acted upon by an external force .', 'the second law states that the rate of change of momentum of an object is directly proportional to the force applied or for an object with constant mass that the net force on an object is equal to the mass of that object multiplied by the acceleration .', 'the third law states that when one object exerts a force on a second object that second object exerts a force that is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction on the first object.', 'the three laws of motion were first compiled by isaac newton in his philosophi naturalis principia mathematica   first published in .', 'newton used them to explain and investigate the motion of many physical objects and systems which laid the foundation for newtonian mechanics .', 'contents inertia the first law states that an object at rest will stay at rest and an object in motion will stay in motion unless acted on by a net external force .', 'mathematically this is equivalent to saying that if the net force on an object is zero then the velocity of the object is constant.', 'where force summation velocity derivative newton first law is often referred to as the principle of inertia .', 'newton first and second law is valid only in an inertial reference frame .', 'the second law states that the rate of change of momentum of a body over time is directly proportional to the force applied and occurs in the same direction as the applied force.', 'where is the momentum of the body.', 'some textbooks use newton second law as a of force     but this has been disparaged in other textbooks.', 'for objects and systems with constant mass    the second law can be re-stated in terms of an object acceleration.', 'where is the net force applied is the mass of the body and is the body acceleration.', 'thus the net force applied to a body produces a proportional acceleration.', 'variable-mass system variable-mass systems like a rocket burning fuel and ejecting spent gases are not closed and cannot be directly treated by making mass a function of time in the second law   the equation of motion for a body whose mass varies with time by either ejecting or accreting mass is obtained by applying the second law to the entire constant-mass system consisting of the body and its ejected or accreted mass the result is  where is the exhaust velocity of the escaping or incoming mass relative to the body.', 'from this equation one can derive the equation of motion for a varying mass system for example the tsiolkovsky rocket equation .', 'under some conventions the quantity on the left-hand side which represents the advection of momentum  is defined as a force the force exerted on the body by the changing mass such as rocket exhaust and is included in the quantity .', 'then by substituting the definition of acceleration the equation becomes  .', 'normal force the third law states that all forces between two objects exist in equal magnitude and opposite direction if one object exerts a force f on a second object  then simultaneously exerts a force f on  and the two forces are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction f  f .', 'the third law means that all forces are interactions between different bodies   or different regions within one body and thus that there is no such thing as a force that is not accompanied by an equal and opposite force.', 'in some situations the magnitude and direction of the forces are determined entirely by one of the two bodies say body  the force exerted by body on body is called the action and the force exerted by body on body is called the reaction.', 'this law is sometimes referred to as the action-reaction law  with f called the action and f the reaction.', 'in other situations the magnitude and directions of the forces are determined jointly by both bodies and it isn necessary to identify one force as the action and the other as the reaction.', 'the action and the reaction are simultaneous and it does not matter which is called the and which is called  both forces are part of a single interaction and neither force exists without the other.', 'the two forces in newton third law are of the same type e.g.', 'if the road exerts a forward frictional force on an accelerating car tires then it is also a frictional force that newton third law predicts for the tires pushing backward on the road.', 'from a conceptual standpoint newton third law is seen when a person walks they push against the floor and the floor pushes against the person.', 'similarly the tires of a car push against the road while the road pushes back on the tiresthe tires and road simultaneously push against each other.', 'in swimming a person interacts with the water pushing the water backward while the water simultaneously pushes the person forwardboth the person and the water push against each other.', 'the reaction forces account for the motion in these examples.', 'these forces depend on friction a person or car on ice for example may be unable to exert the action force to produce the needed reaction force.', 'newton used the third law to derive the law of conservation of momentum   from a deeper perspective however conservation of momentum is the more fundamental idea derived via noether theorem from galilean invariance  and holds in cases where newton third law appears to fail for instance when force fields as well as particles carry momentum and in quantum mechanics .', 'principia mathematica the ancient greek philosopher aristotle had the view that all objects have a natural place in the universe that heavy objects such as rocks wanted to be at rest on the earth and that light objects like smoke wanted to be at rest in the sky and the stars wanted to remain in the heavens.', 'he thought that a body was in its natural state when it was at rest and for the body to move in a straight line at a constant speed an external agent was needed continually to propel it otherwise it would stop moving.', 'galileo galilei  however realised that a force is necessary to change the velocity of a body i.e.', 'acceleration but no force is needed to maintain its velocity.', 'in other words galileo stated that in the of a force a moving object will continue moving.', 'the tendency of objects to resist changes in motion was what johannes kepler had called .', 'this insight was refined by newton who made it into his first law also known as the law of inertiano force means no acceleration and hence the body will maintain its velocity.', 'as newton first law is a restatement of the law of inertia which galileo had already described newton appropriately gave credit to galileo.', 'newton laws were verified by experiment and observation for over years and they are excellent approximations at the scales and speeds of everyday life.', 'newton laws of motion together with his law of universal gravitation and the mathematical techniques of calculus  provided for the first time a unified quantitative explanation for a wide range of physical phenomena.', 'for example in the third volume of the  newton showed that his laws of motion combined with the law of universal gravitation  explained kepler laws of planetary motion .', 'newton laws are applied to bodies which are idealised as single point masses  in the sense that the size and shape of the body are neglected to focus on its motion more easily.', 'this can be done when the line of action of the resultant of all the external forces acts through the center of mass of the body.', 'in this way even a planet can be idealised as a particle for analysis of its orbital motion around a star.', 'in their original form newton laws of motion are not adequate to characterise the motion of rigid bodies and deformable bodies .', 'leonhard euler in introduced a generalisation of newton laws of motion for rigid bodies called euler laws of motion  later applied as well for deformable bodies assumed as a continuum .', 'if a body is represented as an assemblage of discrete particles each governed by newton laws of motion then euler laws can be derived from newton laws.', 'euler laws can however be taken as axioms describing the laws of motion for extended bodies independently of any particle structure.', 'newton laws hold only with respect to a certain set of frames of reference called newtonian or inertial reference frames .', 'some authors interpret the first law as defining what an inertial reference frame is from this point of view the second law holds only when the observation is made from an inertial reference frame and therefore the first law cannot be proved as a special case of the second.', 'other authors do treat the first law as a corollary of the second.', 'the explicit concept of an inertial frame of reference was not developed until long after newton death.', 'these three laws hold to a good approximation for macroscopic objects under everyday conditions.', 'however newton laws combined with universal gravitation and classical electrodynamics  are inappropriate for use in certain circumstances most notably at very small scales at very high speeds or in very strong gravitational fields.', 'therefore the laws cannot be used to explain phenomena such as conduction of electricity in a semiconductor  optical properties of substances errors in non-relativistically corrected gps systems and superconductivity .', 'explanation of these phenomena requires more sophisticated physical theories including general relativity and quantum field theory .', 'in special relativity  the second law holds in the original form f d p d  where f and p are four-vectors .', 'special relativity reduces to newtonian mechanics when the speeds involved are much less than the speed of light .', 'some also describe a fourth law

then are fixed.', 'some textbooks use newton second law as a of force     but this has been disparaged in other textbooks.', 'notable physicists philosophers and mathematicians who have sought a more explicit definition of the concept of force include ernst mach and walter noll .', 'newton second law can be used to measure the strength of forces.', 'for instance knowledge of the masses of planets

simultaneously exerts an equal and opposite force on the first.', 'in vector form if is the force of body on body and that of body on body  then this law is sometimes referred to as the  with called the and the reaction .', 'newton third law is a result of applying symmetry to situations where forces can be attributed to the presence of different objects.', 'the third law means that all forces

the system due to their mutual interactions is zero more generally in a closed system of particles all internal forces are balanced.', 'the particles may accelerate with respect to each other but the center of mass of the system will not accelerate.', 'if an external force acts on the system it will make the center of mass accelerate in proportion to the magnitude of the external force divided by the mass of the system.', 'combining newton second and third laws it is possible to show that the linear momentum of a system is conserved .', 'in a system of two particles if is the momentum of object and the momentum of object  then using similar arguments this can be generalized to a system with an arbitrary number of particles.', 'in general as long as all forces are due to the interaction of objects with mass it is possible to define a system such that net momentum is never lost nor gained.', 'edit in the special theory of relativity  mass and energy are equivalent as can be seen by calculating the work required to accelerate an object.', 'when an object velocity increases so does its energy and hence its mass equivalent inertia.', 'it thus requires more force to accelerate it the same amount than it did at a lower velocity.', 'newton second law remains valid because it is a mathematical definition.', 'but for relativistic momentum to be conserved it must be

'through experimentation it is determined that laboratory measurements of forces are fully consistent with the conceptual definition of force offered by newtonian mechanics .', 'forces act in a particular direction and have sizes dependent upon how strong the push or pull is.', 'because of these characteristics forces are classified as  vector quantities .', 'this means that forces follow a different set of mathematical rules than physical quantities that do not have direction denoted scalar quantities.', 'for example when determining what happens when two forces act on the same object it is necessary to know both the magnitude and the direction of both forces to calculate the result .', 'if both of these pieces of information are not known for each force the situation is ambiguous.', 'for example if you know that two people are pulling on the same rope with known magnitudes of force but you do not know which direction either person is pulling it is impossible to determine what the acceleration of the rope will be.', 'the two people could be pulling against each other as in tug of war or the two people could be pulling in the same direction.', 'in this simple one-dimensional example without knowing the direction of the forces it is impossible to decide whether the net force is the result of adding the two force magnitudes or subtracting one from the

mainly due to the magnetic moments of their atoms  orbiting electrons .', 'the magnetic moments of the nuclei of atoms are typically thousands of times smaller than the electrons magnetic moments so they are negligible in the context of the magnetization of materials.', 'nuclear magnetic moments are nevertheless very important in other contexts particularly in nuclear magnetic resonance nmr and magnetic resonance imaging mri.', 'ordinarily the enormous number of electrons in a material are arranged such that their magnetic moments both orbital and intrinsic cancel out.', 'this is due to some extent to electrons combining into pairs with opposite intrinsic magnetic moments as a result of the pauli exclusion principle see electron configuration  and combining into filled subshells with zero net orbital motion.', 'in both cases the electrons preferentially adopt arrangements in which the magnetic moment of each electron is canceled by the opposite moment of another electron.', 'moreover even when the electron configuration such that there are unpaired electrons andor non-filled subshells it is often the case that the various electrons in the solid will contribute magnetic moments that point in different random directions so that the material will not be magnetic.', 'sometimes either spontaneously or owing to an applied external magnetic fieldeach of the electron magnetic moments will be on average lined up.', 'a suitable material can then produce a strong net magnetic field.', 'the magnetic behavior of a material depends on its structure particularly its electron configuration  for the reasons mentioned above and also on the temperature.', 'at high temperatures random thermal motion makes it more difficult for the electrons to maintain alignment.', 'edit  edit diamagnetism diamagnetism appears in all materials and is the tendency of a material to oppose an applied magnetic field and therefore to be repelled by a magnetic field.', 'however in a material with paramagnetic properties that is with a tendency to enhance an external magnetic field the paramagnetic behavior dominates.', 'thus despite its universal occurrence diamagnetic behavior is observed only in a purely diamagnetic material.', 'in a diamagnetic material there are no unpaired electrons so the intrinsic electron magnetic moments cannot produce any bulk effect.', 'in these cases the magnetization arises from the electrons orbital motions which can be understood classically as follows when a material is put in a magnetic field the electrons circling the nucleus will experience in addition to their coulomb attraction to the nucleus a lorentz force from the magnetic field.', 'depending on which direction the electron is orbiting this force may increase the centripetal force on the electrons pulling them in towards the nucleus or it may decrease the force pulling them away from the nucleus.', 'this effect systematically increases the orbital magnetic moments that were aligned opposite the field and decreases the ones aligned parallel to the field in accordance with lenz law .', 'this results in a small bulk magnetic moment with an opposite direction to the applied field.', 'this description is meant only as a heuristic  the bohrvan leeuwen theorem shows that diamagnetism is impossible according to classical physics and that a proper understanding requires a quantum-mechanical description.', 'all materials undergo this orbital response.', 'however in paramagnetic and ferromagnetic substances the diamagnetic effect is overwhelmed by the much stronger effects caused by the unpaired electrons.', 'edit paramagnetism in a paramagnetic material there are  i.e.', 'atomic or molecular orbitals with exactly one electron in them.', 'while paired electrons are required by the pauli exclusion principle to have their intrinsic  magnetic moments pointing in opposite directions causing their magnetic fields to cancel out an unpaired electron is free to align its magnetic moment in any direction.', 'when an external magnetic field is applied these magnetic moments will tend to align themselves in the same direction as the applied field thus reinforcing it.', 'edit ferromagnetism a ferromagnet like a paramagnetic substance has unpaired electrons.', 'however in addition to the electrons intrinsic magnetic moment tendency to be parallel to an applied field there is also in these materials a tendency for these magnetic moments to orient parallel to each other to maintain a lowered-energy state.', 'thus even in the absence of an applied field the magnetic moments of the electrons in the material spontaneously line up parallel to one another.', 'every ferromagnetic substance has its own individual temperature called the curie temperature  or curie point above which it loses its ferromagnetic properties.', 'this is because the thermal tendency to disorder overwhelms the energy-lowering due to ferromagnetic order.', 'ferromagnetism only occurs in a few substances common ones are iron  nickel  cobalt  their alloys  and some alloys of rare-earth metals.', 'edit magnetic domains the magnetic moments of atoms in a ferromagnetic material cause them to behave something like tiny permanent magnets.', 'they stick together and align themselves into small regions of more or less uniform alignment called magnetic domains or weiss domains .', 'magnetic domains can be observed with a magnetic force microscope to reveal magnetic domain boundaries that resemble white lines in the sketch.', 'there are many scientific experiments that can physically show magnetic fields.', 'when a domain contains too many molecules it becomes unstable and divides into two domains aligned in opposite directions so that they stick together more stably as shown at the right.', 'when exposed to a magnetic field the domain boundaries move so that the domains aligned with the magnetic field grow and dominate the structure dotted yellow area as shown at the left.', 'when the magnetizing field is removed the domains may not return to an unmagnetized state.', 'this results in the ferromagnetic material being magnetized forming a permanent magnet.', 'when magnetized strongly enough that the prevailing domain overruns all others to result in only one single domain the material is magnetically saturated .', 'when a magnetized ferromagnetic material is heated to the curie point temperature the molecules are agitated to the point that the magnetic domains lose the organization and the magnetic properties they cause cease.', 'when the material is cooled this domain alignment structure spontaneously returns in a manner roughly analogous to how a liquid can freeze into a crystalline solid.', 'edit antiferromagnetism in an antiferromagnet  unlike a ferromagnet there is a tendency for the intrinsic magnetic moments of neighboring valence electrons to point in directions.', 'when all atoms are arranged in a substance so that each neighbor is anti-parallel the substance is antiferromagnetic .', 'antiferromagnets have a zero net magnetic moment meaning that no field is produced by them.', 'antiferromagnets are less common compared to the other types of behaviors and are mostly observed at low temperatures.', 'in varying temperatures antiferromagnets can be seen to exhibit diamagnetic and ferromagnetic properties.', 'in some materials neighboring electrons prefer to point in opposite directions but there is no geometrical arrangement in which pair of neighbors is anti-aligned.', 'this is called a spin glass and is an example of geometrical frustration .', 'edit ferrimagnetic ferrimagnetism like ferromagnetism ferrimagnets retain their magnetization in the absence of a field.', 'however like antiferromagnets neighboring pairs of electron spins tend to point in opposite directions.', 'these two properties are not contradictory because in the optimal geometrical arrangement there is more magnetic moment from the sublattice of electrons that point in one direction than from the sublattice that points in the opposite direction.', 'most ferrites are ferrimagnetic.', 'the first discovered magnetic substance magnetite  is a ferrite and was originally believed to be a ferromagnet louis nel disproved this however after discovering ferrimagnetism.', 'edit superparamagnetism when a ferromagnet or ferrimagnet is sufficiently small it acts like a single magnetic spin that is subject to brownian motion .', 'its response to a magnetic field is qualitatively similar to the response of a paramagnet but much larger.', 'edit metamagnetism molecule-based magnets single-molecule magnet spin glass edit an electromagnet is a type of magnet in which the magnetic field is produced by an electric current .', 'the magnetic field disappears when the current is turned off.', 'electromagnets usually consist of a large number of closely spaced turns of wire that create the magnetic field.', 'the wire turns are often wound around a magnetic core made from a ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic material such as iron  the magnetic core concentrates the magnetic flux and makes a more powerful magnet.', 'the main advantage of an electromagnet over a permanent magnet is that the magnetic field can be quickly changed by controlling the amount of electric current in the winding.', 'however unlike a permanent magnet that needs no power an electromagnet requires a continuous supply of current to maintain the magnetic field.', 'electromagnets are widely used as components of other electrical devices such as motors  generators  relays  solenoids loudspeakers  hard disks  mri machines  scientific instruments and magnetic separation equipment.', 'electromagnets are also employed in industry for picking up and moving heavy iron objects such as scrap iron and steel.', 'electromagnetism was discovered in .', 'edit classical electromagnetism and special relativity as a consequence of einstein theory of special relativity electricity and magnetism are fundamentally interlinked.', 'both magnetism lacking electricity and electricity without magnetism are inconsistent with special relativity due to such effects as length contraction  time dilation  and the fact that the magnetic force is velocity-dependent.', 'however when both electricity and magnetism are taken into account the resulting theory  electromagnetism  is fully consistent with special relativity.', 'in particular a phenomenon that appears purely electric or purely magnetic to one observer may be a mix of both to another or more generally the relative contributions of electricity and magnetism are dependent on the frame of reference.', 'thus special relativity mixes electricity and magnetism into a single inseparable phenomenon called electromagnetism  analogous to how relativity mixes space and time into spacetime .', 'all observations on electromagnetism apply to what might be considered to be primarily magnetism e.g.', 'perturbations in the magnetic field are necessarily accompanied by a nonzero electric field and propagate at the speed of light .', 'edit magnetic field h and b inside and outside of magnetic materials in a vacuum where is the vacuum permeability .', 'in a material the quantity m is called .', 'if the field h is small the response of the magnetization m in a diamagnet or paramagnet is approximately linear the constant of proportionality being called the magnetic susceptibility.', 'if so in a hard magnet such as a ferromagnet m is not proportional to the field and is generally nonzero even when h is zero see remanence .', 'edit magnetic field the phenomenon of magnetism is mediated by the magnetic field.', 'an electric current or magnetic dipole creates a magnetic field and that field in turn imparts magnetic forces on other particles that are in the fields.', 'maxwell equations which simplify to the biotsavart law in the case of steady currents describe the origin and behavior of the fields that govern these forces.', 'therefore magnetism is seen whenever electrically charged particles are in motion for example from movement of electrons in an electric current  or in certain cases from the orbital motion of electrons around an atom nucleus.', 'they also arise from intrinsic magnetic dipoles arising from quantum-mechanical spin .', 'the same situations that create magnetic fieldscharge moving in a current or in an atom and intrinsic magnetic dipolesare also the situations in which a magnetic field has an effect creating a force.', 'following is the formula for moving charge for the forces on an intrinsic dipole see magnetic dipole.', 'when a charged particle moves through a magnetic field b  it feels a lorentz force f given by the cross product   where v velocity vector because this is a cross product the force is perpendicular to both the motion of the particle and the magnetic field.', 'it follows that the magnetic force does no work on the particle it may change the direction of the particle movement but it cannot cause it to speed up or slow down.', 'the magnitude of the force is where is the angle between v and b .', 'one tool for determining the direction of the velocity vector of a moving charge the magnetic field and the force exerted is labeling the index finger v the middle finger b and the thumb f with your right hand.', 'when making a gun-like configuration with the middle finger crossing under the index finger the fingers represent the velocity vector magnetic field vector and force vector respectively.', 'see also right-hand rule .', 'edit magnetic dipole a very common source of magnetic field found in nature is a dipole  with a  south pole  and a  north pole  terms dating back to the use of magnets as compasses interacting with the earth magnetic field to indicate north and south on the globe .', 'since opposite ends of magnets are attracted the north pole of a magnet is attracted to the south pole of another magnet.', 'the earth north magnetic pole currently in the arctic ocean north of canada is physically a south pole as it attracts the north pole of a compass.', 'a magnetic field contains energy  and physical systems move toward configurations with lower energy.', 'when diamagnetic material is placed in a magnetic field a tends to align itself in opposed polarity to that field thereby lowering the net field strength.', 'when ferromagnetic material is placed within a magnetic field the magnetic dipoles align to the applied field thus expanding the domain walls of the magnetic domains.', 'edit magnetic monopole since a bar magnet gets its ferromagnetism from electrons distributed evenly throughout the bar when a bar magnet is cut in half each of the resulting pieces is a smaller bar magnet.', 'even though a magnet is said to have a north pole and a south pole these two poles cannot be separated from each other.', 'a monopoleif such a thing existswould be a new and fundamentally different kind of magnetic object.', 'it would act as an isolated north pole not attached to a south pole or vice versa.', 'monopoles would carry magnetic charge analogous to electric charge.', 'despite systematic searches since  as of update  they have never been observed and could very well not exist.', 'nevertheless some theoretical physics models predict the existence of these magnetic monopoles .', 'paul dirac observed in that because electricity and magnetism show a certain symmetry  just as quantum theory predicts that individual positive or negative electric charges can be observed without the opposing charge isolated south or north magnetic poles should be observable.', 'using quantum theory dirac showed that if magnetic monopoles exist then one could explain the quantization of electric chargethat is why the observed elementary particles carry charges that are multiples of the charge of the electron.', 'certain grand unified theories predict the existence of monopoles which unlike elementary particles are solitons localized energy packets.', 'the initial results of using these models to estimate the number of monopoles created in the big bang contradicted cosmological observationsthe monopoles would have been so plentiful and massive that they would have long since halted the expansion of the universe.', 'however the idea of inflation for which this problem served as a partial motivation was successful in solving this problem creating models in which monopoles

statistics cookie statement state of matter jump to navigation jump to search phase matter ice sculpture drop electrical arcing tesla coil in physics  a state of matter is one of the distinct forms in which matter can exist.', 'four states of matter are observable in everyday life solid  liquid  gas  and plasma .', 'many intermediate states are known to exist such as liquid crystal  and some states only exist under extreme conditions such as boseeinstein condensates  neutron-degenerate matter  and quarkgluon plasma  which only occur respectively in situations of extreme cold extreme density and extremely high energy.', 'for a complete list of all exotic states of matter see the list of states of matter .', 'historically the distinction is made based on qualitative differences in properties.', 'matter in the solid state maintains a fixed volume and shape with component particles  atoms  molecules or ions  close together and fixed into place.', 'matter in the liquid state maintains a fixed volume but has a variable shape that adapts to fit its container.', 'its particles are still close together but move freely.', 'matter in the gaseous state has both variable volume and shape adapting both to fit its container.', 'its particles are neither close together nor fixed in place.', 'matter in the plasma state has variable volume and shape and contains neutral atoms as well as a significant number of ions and electrons both of which can move around freely.', 'the term phase is sometimes used as a synonym for state of matter but a system can contain several immiscible phases of the same state of matter.', 'contents strontium titanate strontium titanium solid in a solid constituent particles ions atoms or molecules are closely packed together.', 'the forces between particles are so strong that the particles cannot move freely but can only vibrate.', 'as a result a solid has a stable definite shape and a definite volume.', 'solids can only change their shape by an outside force as when broken or cut.', 'in crystalline solids  the particles atoms molecules or ions are packed in a regularly ordered repeating pattern.', 'there are various different crystal structures  and the same substance can have more than one structure or solid phase.', 'for example iron has a body-centred cubic structure at temperatures below  and a face-centred cubic structure between and  .', 'ice has fifteen known crystal structures or fifteen solid phases which exist at various temperatures and pressures.', 'glasses and other non-crystalline amorphous solids without long-range order are not thermal equilibrium ground states therefore they are described below as nonclassical states of matter.', 'solids can be transformed into liquids by melting and liquids can be transformed into solids by freezing.', 'solids can also change directly into gases through the process of sublimation  and gases can likewise change directly into solids through deposition .', 'liquid a liquid is a nearly incompressible fluid that conforms to the shape of its container but retains a nearly constant volume independent of pressure.', 'the volume is definite if the temperature and pressure are constant.', 'when a solid is heated above its melting point  it becomes liquid given that the pressure is higher than the triple point of the substance.', 'intermolecular or interatomic or interionic forces are still important but the molecules have enough energy to move relative to each other and the structure is mobile.', 'this means that the shape of a liquid is not definite but is determined by its container.', 'the volume is usually greater than that of the corresponding solid the best known exception being water  h o. the highest temperature at which a given liquid can exist is its critical temperature .', 'gas a gas is a compressible fluid.', 'not only will a gas conform to the shape of its container but it will also expand to fill the container.', 'in a gas the molecules have enough kinetic energy so that the effect of intermolecular forces is small or zero for an ideal gas  and the typical distance between neighboring molecules is much greater than the molecular size.', 'a gas has no definite shape or volume but occupies the entire container in which it is confined.', 'a liquid may be converted to a gas by heating at constant pressure to the boiling point  or else by reducing the pressure at constant temperature.', 'at temperatures below its critical temperature  a gas is also called a vapor  and can be liquefied by compression alone without cooling.', 'a vapor can exist in equilibrium with a liquid or solid in which case the gas pressure equals the vapor pressure of the liquid or solid.', 'a supercritical fluid scf is a gas whose temperature and pressure are above the critical temperature and critical pressure respectively.', 'in this state the distinction between liquid and gas disappears.', 'a supercritical fluid has the physical properties of a gas but its high density confers solvent properties in some cases which leads to useful applications.', 'for example supercritical carbon dioxide is used to extract caffeine in the manufacture of decaffeinated coffee.', 'plasma physics like a gas plasma does not have definite shape or volume.', 'unlike gases plasmas are electrically conductive produce magnetic fields and electric currents and respond strongly to electromagnetic forces.', 'positively charged nuclei swim in a sea of freely-moving disassociated electrons similar to the way such charges exist in conductive metal where this electron sea allows matter in the plasma state to conduct electricity.', 'a gas is usually converted to a plasma in one of two ways e.g.', 'either from a huge voltage difference between two points or by exposing it to extremely high temperatures.', 'heating matter to high temperatures causes electrons to leave the atoms resulting in the presence of free electrons.', 'this creates a so-called partially ionised plasma.', 'at very high temperatures such as those present in stars it is assumed that essentially all electrons are free and that a very high-energy plasma is essentially bare nuclei swimming in a sea of electrons.', 'this forms the so-called fully ionised plasma.', 'the plasma state is often misunderstood and although not freely existing under normal conditions on earth it is quite commonly generated by either lightning  electric sparks  fluorescent lights  neon lights or in plasma televisions .', 'the sun corona  some types of flame  and stars are all examples of illuminated matter in the plasma state.', 'phase transitions a state of matter is also characterized by phase transitions .', 'a phase transition indicates a change in structure and can be recognized by an abrupt change in properties.', 'a distinct state of matter can be defined as any set of states distinguished from any other set of states by a phase transition .', 'water can be said to have several distinct solid states.', 'the appearance of superconductivity is associated with a phase transition so there are superconductive states.', 'likewise ferromagnetic states are demarcated by phase transitions and have distinctive properties.', 'when the change of state occurs in stages the intermediate steps are called mesophases .', 'such phases have been exploited by the introduction of liquid crystal technology.', 'the state or of a given set of matter can change depending on pressure and temperature conditions transitioning to other phases as these conditions change to favor their existence for example solid transitions to liquid with an increase in temperature.', 'near absolute zero  a substance exists as a solid .', 'as heat is added to this substance it melts into a liquid at its melting point  boils into a gas at its boiling point  and if heated high enough would enter a plasma state in which the electrons are so energized that they leave their parent atoms.', 'forms of matter that are not composed of molecules and are organized by different forces can also be considered different states of matter.', 'superfluids like fermionic condensate  and the quarkgluon plasma are examples.', 'in a chemical equation the state of matter of the chemicals may be shown as s for solid l for liquid and g for gas.', 'an aqueous solution is denoted aq.', 'matter in the plasma state is seldom used if at all in chemical equations so there is no standard symbol to denote it.', 'in the rare equations that plasma is used it is symbolized as p. glass glass is a non-crystalline or amorphous solid material that exhibits a glass transition when heated towards the liquid state.', 'glasses can be made of quite different classes of materials inorganic networks such as window glass made of silicate plus additives metallic alloys ionic melts aqueous solutions molecular liquids and polymers.', 'thermodynamically a glass is in a metastable state with respect to its crystalline counterpart.', 'the conversion rate however is practically zero.', 'a plastic crystal is a molecular solid with long-range positional order but with constituent molecules retaining rotational freedom in an orientational glass this degree of freedom is frozen in a quenched disordered state.', 'similarly in a spin glass magnetic disorder is frozen.', 'liquid crystal liquid crystal states have properties intermediate between mobile liquids and ordered solids.', 'generally they are able to flow like a liquid but exhibiting long-range order.', 'for example the nematic phase consists of long rod-like molecules such as para-azoxyanisole  which is nematic in the temperature range .', 'in this state the molecules flow as in a liquid but they all point in the same direction within each domain and cannot rotate freely.', 'like a crystalline solid but unlike a liquid liquid crystals react to polarized light.', 'other types of liquid crystals are described in the main article on these states.', 'several types have technological importance for example in liquid crystal displays .', 'transition metal atoms often have magnetic moments due to the net spin of electrons that remain unpaired and do not form chemical bonds.', 'in some solids the magnetic moments on different atoms are ordered and can form a ferromagnet an antiferromagnet or a ferrimagnet.', 'in a ferromagnet for instance solid iron the magnetic moment on each atom is aligned in the same direction within a magnetic domain .', 'if the domains are also aligned the solid is a permanent magnet  which is magnetic even in the absence of an external magnetic field .', 'the magnetization disappears when the magnet is heated to the curie point  which for iron is .', 'an antiferromagnet has two networks of equal and opposite magnetic moments which cancel each other out so that the net magnetization is zero.', 'for example in nickelii oxide nio half the nickel atoms have moments aligned in one direction and half in the opposite direction.', 'in a ferrimagnet  the two networks of magnetic moments are opposite but unequal so that cancellation is incomplete and there is a non-zero net magnetization.', 'an example is magnetite fe o  which contains fe and fe ions with different magnetic moments.', 'a quantum spin liquid qsl is a disordered state in a system of interacting quantum spins which preserves its disorder to very low temperatures unlike other disordered states.', 'it is not a liquid in physical sense but a solid whose magnetic order is inherently disordered.', 'the name liquid is due to an analogy with the molecular disorder in a conventional liquid.', 'a qsl is neither a ferromagnet  where magnetic domains are parallel nor an antiferromagnet  where the magnetic domains are antiparallel instead the magnetic domains are randomly oriented.', 'this can be realized e.g.', 'by geometrically frustrated magnetic moments that cannot point uniformly parallel or antiparallel.', 'when cooling down and settling to a state the domain must choose an orientation but if the possible states are similar in energy one will be chosen randomly.', 'consequently despite strong short-range order there is no long-range magnetic order.', 'copolymer tem copolymers can undergo microphase separation to form a diverse array of periodic nanostructures as shown in the example of the styrene-butadiene-styrene block copolymer shown at right.', 'microphase separation can be understood by analogy to the phase separation between oil and water.', 'due to chemical incompatibility between the blocks block copolymers undergo a similar phase separation.', 'however because the blocks are covalently bonded to each other they cannot demix macroscopically as water and oil can and so instead the blocks form nanometre-sized structures.', 'depending on the relative lengths of each block and the overall block topology of the polymer many morphologies can be obtained each its own phase of matter.', 'ionic liquids also display microphase separation.', 'the anion and cation are not necessarily compatible and would demix otherwise but electric charge attraction prevents them from separating.', 'their anions and cations appear to diffuse within compartmentalized layers or micelles instead of freely as in a uniform liquid.', 'liquid helium rollin film superfluid close to absolute zero some liquids form a second liquid state described as superfluid because it has zero viscosity or infinite fluidity i.e.', 'flowing without friction.', 'this was discovered in for helium  which forms a superfluid below the lambda temperature of .', '.', '.. in this state it will attempt to climb out of its container.', 'it also has infinite thermal conductivity so that no temperature gradient can form in a superfluid.', 'placing a superfluid in a spinning container will result in quantized vortices .', 'these properties are explained by the theory that the common isotope helium- forms a boseeinstein condensate see next section in the superfluid state.', 'more recently fermionic condensate superfluids have been formed at even lower temperatures by the rare isotope helium- and by lithium- .', 'rubidium boseeinstein condensate in  albert einstein and satyendra nath bose predicted the boseeinstein condensate bec sometimes referred to as the fifth state of matter.', 'in a bec matter stops behaving as independent particles and collapses into a single quantum state that can be described with a single uniform wavefunction.', 'in the gas phase the boseeinstein condensate remained an unverified theoretical prediction for many years.', 'in  the research groups of eric cornell and carl wieman  of jila at the university of colorado at boulder  produced the first such condensate experimentally.', 'a boseeinstein condensate is colder than a solid.', 'it may occur when atoms have very similar or the same quantum levels  at temperatures very close to absolute zero  .', '.. fermionic condensate a is similar to the boseeinstein condensate but composed of fermions .', 'the pauli exclusion principle prevents fermions from entering the same quantum state but a pair of fermions can behave as a boson and multiple such pairs can then enter the same quantum state without restriction.', 'one of the metastable states of strongly non-ideal plasma are condensates of excited atoms .', 'these atoms can also turn into ions and electrons if they reach a certain temperature.', 'in april  nature reported the creation of rydberg molecules from a rydberg atom and a ground state atom  confirming that such a state of matter could exist.', 'the experiment was performed using ultracold rubidium atoms.', 'quantum hall effect a gives rise to quantized hall voltage measured in the direction perpendicular to the current flow.', 'a quantum spin hall state is a theoretical phase that may pave the way for the development of electronic devices that dissipate less energy and generate less heat.', 'this is a derivation of the quantum hall state of matter.', 'photonic matter photonic matter is a phenomenon where photons interacting with a gas develop apparent mass and can interact with each other even forming photonic molecules.', 'the source of mass is the gas which is massive.', 'this is in contrast to photons moving in empty space which have no rest mass  and cannot interact.', 'dropleton a quantum fog of electrons and holes that flow around each other and even ripple like a liquid rather than existing as discrete pairs.', 'degenerate matter under extremely high pressure as in the cores of dead stars ordinary matter undergoes a transition to a series of exotic states of matter collectively known as degenerate matter  which are supported mainly by quantum mechanical effects.', 'in physics degenerate refers to two states that have the same energy and are thus interchangeable.', 'degenerate matter is supported by the pauli exclusion principle  which prevents two fermionic particles from occupying the same quantum state.', 'unlike regular plasma degenerate plasma expands little when heated because there are simply no momentum states left.', 'consequently degenerate stars collapse into very high densities.', 'more massive degenerate stars are smaller because the gravitational force increases but pressure does not increase proportionally.', 'electron-degenerate matter is found inside white dwarf stars.', 'electrons remain bound to atoms but are able to transfer to adjacent atoms.', 'neutron-degenerate matter is found in neutron stars .', 'vast gravitational pressure compresses atoms so strongly that the electrons are forced to combine with protons via inverse beta-decay resulting in a superdense conglomeration of neutrons.', 'normally free neutrons outside an atomic nucleus will decay with a half life of approximately minutes but in a neutron star the decay is overtaken by inverse decay.', 'cold degenerate matter is also present in planets such as jupiter and in the even more massive brown dwarfs  which are expected to have a core with metallic hydrogen .', 'because of the degeneracy more massive brown dwarfs are not significantly larger.', 'in metals the electrons can be modeled as a degenerate gas moving in a lattice of non-degenerate positive ions.', 'qcd matter in regular cold matter quarks  fundamental particles of nuclear matter are confined by the strong force into hadrons that consist of quarks such as protons and neutrons.', 'quark matter or quantum chromodynamical qcd matter is a group of phases where the strong force is overcome and quarks are deconfined and free to move.', 'quark matter phases occur at extremely high densities or temperatures and there are no known ways to produce them in equilibrium in the laboratory in ordinary conditions any quark matter formed immediately undergoes radioactive decay.', 'strange matter is a type of quark matter that is suspected to exist inside some neutron stars close to the tolmanoppenheimervolkoff limit approximately solar masses  although there is no direct evidence of its existence.', 'in strange matter part of the energy available manifests as strange quarks  a heavier analogue of the common down quark .', 'it may be stable at lower energy states once formed although this is not known.', 'quarkgluon plasma is a very high-temperature phase in which quarks become free and able to move independently rather than being perpetually bound into particles in a sea of gluons  subatomic particles that transmit the strong force that binds quarks together.', 'this is analogous to the liberation of electrons from atoms in a plasma.', 'this state is briefly attainable in extremely high-energy heavy ion collisions in particle accelerators  and allows scientists to observe the properties of individual quarks and not just theorize.', 'quarkgluon plasma was discovered at cern in .', 'unlike plasma which flows like a gas interactions within qgp are strong and it flows like a liquid.', 'at high densities but relatively low temperatures quarks are theorized to form a quark liquid whose nature is presently unknown.', 'it forms a distinct color-flavor locked cfl phase at even higher densities.', 'this phase is superconductive for color charge.', 'these phases may occur in neutron stars but they are presently theoretical.', 'color-glass condensate color-glass condensate is a type of matter theorized to exist in atomic nuclei traveling near the speed of light.', 'according to einstein theory of relativity a high-energy nucleus appears length contracted or compressed along its direction of motion.', 'as a result the gluons inside the nucleus appear to a stationary observer as a gluonic wall traveling near the speed of light.', 'at very high energies the density of the gluons in this wall is seen to increase greatly.', 'unlike the quarkgluon plasma produced in the collision of such walls the color-glass condensate describes the walls themselves and is an intrinsic property of the particles that can only be observed under high-energy conditions such as those at rhic and possibly at the large hadron collider as well.', 'various theories predict new states of matter at very high energies.', 'an unknown state has created the baryon asymmetry in the universe but little is known about it.', 'in string theory  a hagedorn temperature is predicted for superstrings at about k where superstrings are copiously produced.', 'at planck temperature  k gravity becomes a significant force between individual particles.', 'no current theory can describe these states and they cannot be produced with any foreseeable experiment.', 'however these states are important in cosmology because the universe may have passed through these states in the big bang .', 'the gravitational singularity predicted by general relativity to exist at the center of a black hole is a phase of matter it is not a material object at all although the mass-energy of matter contributed to its creation but rather a property of spacetime .', 'because spacetime breaks down there the singularity should not be thought of as a localized structure but as a global topological feature of spacetime.', 'it has been argued that elementary particles are fundamentally not material either but are localized properties of spacetime.', 'in quantum gravity singularities may in fact mark transitions to a new phase of matter.', 'supersolid a supersolid is a spatially ordered material that is a solid or crystal with superfluid properties.', 'similar to a superfluid a supersolid is able to move without friction but retains a rigid shape.', 'although a supersolid is a solid it exhibits so many characteristic properties different from other solids that many argue it is another state of matter.', 'string-net liquid in a string-net liquid atoms have apparently unstable arrangement like a liquid but are still consistent in overall pattern like a solid.', 'when in a normal solid state the atoms of matter align themselves in a grid pattern so that the spin of any electron is the opposite of the spin of all electrons touching it.', 'but in a string-net liquid atoms are arranged in some pattern that requires some electrons to have neighbors with the same spin.', 'this gives rise to curious properties as well as supporting some unusual proposals about the fundamental conditions of the universe itself.', 'superglass a superglass is a phase of matter characterized at the same time by superfluidity and a frozen amorphous structure.', 'although multiple attempts have been made to create a unified definition of the states of matter ultimately much of the definitions of the states of matter is arbitrarily defined.', 'the rigid definitions of what states of matter exist and the point at which states change is defined arbitrarily.', 'the fundamental change of state as seen when an object changes its state is a change of energy  heat as defined as work in physics of the matter meaning it disperses from a point quicker however the point at which a states of matter changes and how many states of matter exist is defined largely arbitrarily.', 'others have suggested that states of matter are better thought of as a spectrum between a solid and plasma instead of being rigidly defined.', 'hidden states of matter classical element condensed matter physics cooling curve phase matter

yielding a solution that determined the location of an electron over time this wave equation also could be used to predict the probability of finding an electron near a position especially a position near where the electron was bound in space for which the electron wave equations did not change in time.', 'this approach led to a second formulation of quantum mechanics the first by heisenberg in

proton lifetime of .', 'however protons are known to transform into neutrons through the process of electron capture also called inverse beta decay .', 'for free protons this process does not occur spontaneously but only when energy is supplied.', 'the equation is the process is reversible neutrons can convert back to protons through beta decay  a common form of radioactive decay .', 'in fact a free neutron decays this way with a mean lifetime of about minutes.', 'edit in quantum chromodynamics  the modern theory of the nuclear force most of the mass of protons and neutrons is explained by special relativity .', 'the mass of a proton is about times greater than the sum of the rest masses of its three valence quarks  while the gluons have zero rest mass.', 'the extra energy of the quarks and gluons in a proton as compared to the rest energy of the quarks alone in the qcd vacuum  accounts for almost  of the proton mass.', 'the rest mass of a proton is thus the invariant mass of the system of moving quarks and gluons that make up the particle and in such systems even the energy of massless particles is still measured as part of the rest mass of the system.', 'two terms are used in referring to the mass of the quarks that make up protons current quark refers to the mass of a quark by itself while constituent quark refers to the current quark mass plus the mass of the gluon particle field surrounding the quark.', 'these masses typically have very different values.', 'the kinetic energy of the quarks that is a consequence of confinement is a contribution see mass in special relativity .', 'the contributions to the mass of the proton are the quark condensate  the quark energy  the gluonic field strength energy  and the anomalous gluonic contribution .', 'the constituent quark model wavefunction for the proton is the internal dynamics of protons are complicated because they are determined by the quarks exchanging gluons and interacting with various vacuum condensates.', 'lattice qcd provides a way of calculating the mass of a proton directly from the theory to any accuracy in principle.', 'the most recent calculations   claim that the mass is determined to better than  accuracy even to  accuracy see figure in drr  .', 'these claims are still controversial because the calculations cannot yet be done with quarks as light as they are in the real world.', 'this means that the predictions are found by a process of extrapolation  which can introduce systematic errors.', 'it is hard to tell whether these errors are controlled properly because the quantities that are compared to experiment are the masses of the hadrons  which are known in advance.', 'these recent calculations are performed by massive supercomputers and as noted by boffi and pasquini a detailed description of the nucleon structure is still missing because ... long-distance behavior requires a nonperturbative andor numerical treatment...  more conceptual approaches to the structure of protons are the topological soliton approach originally due to tony skyrme and the more accurate adsqcd approach that extends it to include a string theory of gluons  various qcd-inspired models like the bag model and the constituent quark model which were popular in the  and the svz sum rules  which allow for rough approximate mass calculations.', 'these methods do not have the same accuracy as the more brute-force lattice qcd methods at least not yet.', 'edit proton radius puzzle the problem of defining a radius for an atomic nucleus proton is similar to the problem of atomic radius  in that neither atoms nor their nuclei have definite boundaries.', 'however the nucleus can be modeled as a sphere of positive charge for the interpretation of electron scattering experiments because there is no definite boundary to the nucleus the electrons see a range of cross-sections for which a mean can be taken.', 'the qualification of rms for  root mean square  arises because it is the nuclear cross-section proportional to the square of the radius which is determining for electron scattering.', 'the internationally accepted value of a proton charge radius is fm see orders of magnitude for comparison to other sizes.', 'this value is based on measurements involving a proton and an electron namely electron scattering measurements and complex calculation involving scattering cross section based on rosenbluth equation for momentum-transfer cross section  and studies of the atomic energy levels of hydrogen and deuterium.', 'however in an international research team published a proton charge radius measurement via the lamb shift in muonic hydrogen an exotic atom made of a proton and a negatively charged muon .', 'as a muon is times heavier than an electron its de broglie wavelength is correspondingly shorter.', 'this smaller atomic orbital is much more sensitive to the proton charge radius so allows more precise measurement.', 'their

proton was published.', 'the precision was improved by .', 'times increasing the significance of the discrepancy to .', 'the codata adjustment slightly reduced the recommended value for the proton radius computed using electron measurements only to  but this leaves the discrepancy at .', '.', 'if no errors were found in the measurements or calculations it would have been necessary to re-examine the world most precise and best-tested fundamental theory quantum electrodynamics .', 'the proton radius was a puzzle as of .', 'a resolution came in  when two different studies using different techniques involving the lamb shift of the electron in hydrogen and electronproton scattering found the radius of the proton to be .', 'with an uncertainty of .', 'and ..   the radius of the proton is linked to the form factor and momentum-transfer cross section .', 'the atomic form factor g modifies the cross section corresponding to point-like proton.', 'the atomic form factor is related to the wave function density of the target the form factor can be split in electric and magnetic form factors.', 'these can be further written as linear combinations of dirac and pauli form factors.', 'edit since the proton is composed of quarks confined by gluons an equivalent pressure which acts on the quarks can be defined.', 'this allows calculation of their distribution as a function of distance from the centre using compton scattering of high-energy electrons dvcs for .', 'the pressure is maximum at the centre about pa which is greater than the pressure inside a neutron star .', 'it is positive repulsive to a radial distance of about .', 'negative attractive at greater distances and very weak beyond about .', 'edit the radius of the hydrated proton appears in the born equation for calculating the hydration enthalpy of hydronium .', 'edit although protons have affinity for oppositely charged electrons this is a relatively low-energy interaction and so free protons must lose sufficient velocity and kinetic energy  in order to become closely associated and bound to electrons.', 'high energy protons in traversing ordinary matter lose energy by collisions with atomic nuclei  and by ionization of atoms removing electrons until they are slowed sufficiently to be captured by the electron cloud in a normal atom.', 'however in such an association with an electron the character of the bound proton is not changed and it remains a proton.', 'the attraction of low-energy free protons to any electrons present in normal matter such as the electrons in normal atoms causes free protons to stop and to form a new chemical bond with an atom.', 'such a bond happens at any sufficiently cold temperature that is comparable to temperatures at the surface of the sun and with any type of atom.', 'thus in interaction with any type of normal non-plasma matter low-velocity free protons do not remain free but are attracted to electrons in any atom or molecule with which they come into contact causing the proton and molecule to combine.', 'such molecules are then said to be  protonated  and chemically they are simply compounds of hydrogen often positively charged.', 'often as a result they become so-called brnsted acids .', 'for example a proton captured by a water molecule in water becomes hydronium  the aqueous cation .', 'edit edit in chemistry  the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom is known as the atomic number  which determines the chemical element to which the atom belongs.', 'for example the atomic number of chlorine is  this means that each chlorine atom has protons and that all atoms with protons are chlorine atoms.', 'the chemical properties of each atom are determined by the number of negatively charged electrons  which for neutral atoms is equal to the number of positive protons so that the total charge is zero.', 'for example a neutral chlorine atom has protons and electrons whereas a cl anion has protons and electrons for a total charge of .', 'all atoms of a given element are not necessarily identical however.', 'the number of neutrons may vary to form different isotopes  and energy levels may differ resulting in different nuclear isomers .', 'for example there are two stable isotopes of chlorine  with  neutrons and with  neutrons.', 'edit hydron chemistry in chemistry the term proton refers to the hydrogen ion .', 'since the atomic number of hydrogen is  a hydrogen ion has no electrons and corresponds to a bare nucleus consisting of a proton and neutrons for the most abundant isotope h .', 'the proton is a bare charge with only about  of the radius of a hydrogen atom and so is extremely reactive chemically.', 'the free proton thus has an extremely short lifetime in chemical systems such as liquids and it reacts immediately with the electron cloud of any available molecule.', 'in aqueous solution it forms the hydronium ion  h o  which in turn is further solvated by water molecules in clusters such as h o  and h o  .', 'the transfer of in an acidbase reaction is usually referred to as proton transfer.', 'the acid is referred to as a proton donor and the base as a proton acceptor.', 'likewise biochemical terms such as proton pump and proton channel refer to the movement of hydrated ions.', 'the ion produced by removing the electron from a deuterium atom is known as a deuteron not a proton.', 'likewise removing an electron from a tritium atom produces a triton.', 'edit also in chemistry the term  proton nmr  refers to the observation of hydrogen- nuclei in mostly organic  molecules by nuclear magnetic resonance .', 'this method uses the spin of the proton which has the value one-half in units of h-bar  .', 'the name refers to examination of protons as they occur in protium hydrogen- atoms in compounds and does not imply that free protons exist in the compound being studied.', 'edit effect of spaceflight on the body proton therapy the apollo lunar surface experiments packages alsep determined that more than  of the particles in the solar wind are electrons and protons in approximately equal numbers.', 'because the solar wind spectrometer made continuous measurements it was possible to measure how the earth magnetic field affects arriving solar wind particles.', 'for about two-thirds of each orbit the moon is outside of the earth magnetic field.', 'at these times a typical proton density was to per cubic centimeter with most protons having velocities between and kilometers per second.', 'for about five days of each month the moon is inside the earth geomagnetic tail and typically no solar wind particles were detectable.', 'for the remainder of each lunar orbit the moon is in a transitional region known as the magnetosheath  where the earth magnetic field affects the solar wind but does not completely exclude it.', 'in this region the particle flux is reduced with typical proton velocities of to kilometers per second.', 'during the lunar night the spectrometer was shielded from the solar wind by the moon and no solar wind particles were measured.', 'protons also have extrasolar origin from galactic cosmic rays  where they make up about  of the total particle flux.', 'these protons often have higher energy than solar wind protons and their intensity is far more uniform and less variable than protons coming from the sun the production of which is heavily affected by solar proton events such as coronal mass ejections .', 'research has been performed on the dose-rate effects of protons as typically found in space travel  on human health.', 'to be more specific there are hopes to identify what specific chromosomes are damaged and to define the damage during cancer development from proton exposure.', 'another study looks into determining the effects of exposure to proton irradiation on neurochemical and behavioral endpoints including dopaminergic functioning amphetamine -induced conditioned taste aversion learning and spatial learning and memory as measured by the morris water maze .', 'electrical charging of a spacecraft due to interplanetary proton bombardment has also been proposed for study.', 'there are many more studies that pertain to space travel including galactic cosmic rays and their possible health effects  and solar proton event exposure.', 'the american biostack and soviet biorack space travel experiments have demonstrated the severity of molecular damage induced by heavy ions on microorganisms including artemia cysts.', 'edit antiproton cpt-symmetry puts strong constraints on the relative properties of particles and antiparticles and therefore is open to stringent tests.', 'for example the charges of a proton and antiproton must sum to exactly zero.', 'this equality has
