interdisciplinary society communication education funding pseudoscience policy sociology outline portal category universe science from the latin word  meaning knowledge  is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe     the earliest roots of science can be traced to ancient egypt and mesopotamia in around to bce    their contributions to mathematics  astronomy  and medicine entered and shaped greek natural philosophy of classical antiquity  whereby formal attempts were made to provide explanations of events in the physical world based on natural causes   after the fall of the western roman empire  knowledge of greek conceptions of the world deteriorated in western europe during the early centuries  to ce of the middle ages   but was preserved in the muslim world during the islamic golden age   the recovery and assimilation of greek works and islamic inquiries into western europe from the to century revived  natural philosophy    which was later transformed by the scientific revolution that began in the century  as new ideas and discoveries departed from previous greek conceptions and traditions     the scientific method soon played a greater role in knowledge creation and it was not until the century that many of the institutional and professional features of science began to take shape    along with the changing of natural philosophy to natural science  modern science is typically divided into three major branches  that consist of the natural sciences eg biology  chemistry  and physics  which study nature in the broadest sense the social sciences eg economics  psychology  and sociology  which study individuals and societies   and the formal sciences eg logic  mathematics  and theoretical computer science  which deal with symbols governed by rules   there is disagreement    however on whether the formal sciences actually constitute a science as they do not rely on empirical evidence    disciplines that use existing scientific knowledge for practical purposes such as engineering and medicine are described as applied sciences       new knowledge in science is advanced by re from scientists who are motivated by curiosity about the world and a desire to solve problems   contemporary scientific re is highly collaborative and is usually done by teams in academic and re institutions   government agencies  and companies    the practical impact of their work has led to the emergence of science policies that seek to influence the scientific enterprise by prioritizing the development of commercial products  armaments  health care  public infrastructure  and environmental protection  contents history of science science in a broad sense existed before the modern era and in many historical civilizations   modern science is distinct in its approach and successful in its results  so it now defines what science is in the strictest sense of the term    science in its original sense was a word for a type of knowledge  rather than a specialized word for the pursuit of such knowledge in particular it was the type of knowledge that people can communicate to each other and share for example knowledge about the working of natural things was gathered long before recorded history and led to the development of complex abstract thought  this is shown by the construction of complex calendars  techniques for making poisonous plants edible public works at a national scale such as those which harnessed the floodplain of the yangtse with reservoirs   dams and dikes and buildings such as the pyramids however no consistent conscious distinction was made between knowledge of such things which are true in every community and other types of communal knowledge such as mythologies and legal systems metallurgy was known in prehistory and the vina culture was the earliest known producer of bronze-like alloys it is thought that early experimentation with heating and mixing of substances over time developed into alchemy  history of science in early cultures livers mari syria the earliest roots of science can be traced to ancient egypt and mesopotamia in around to bce  although the words and concepts of science and nature were not part of the conceptual landscape at the time the ancient egyptians and mesopotamians made contributions that would later find a place in greek and medieval science mathematics astronomy and medicine   starting in around bce the ancient egyptians developed a numbering system that was decimal in character and had orientated their knowledge of geometry to solving practical problems such as those of surveyors and builders  they even developed an official calendar that contained twelve months thirty days each and five days at the end of the year  based on the medical papyri written in the - bce the ancient egyptians believed that disease was mainly caused by the invasion of bodies by evil forces or spirits thus in addition to drug treatments healing therapies would involve prayer  incantation  and ritual  the ancient mesopotamians used knowledge about the properties of various natural chemicals for manufacturing pottery  faience  glass soap metals lime plaster  and waterproofing  they also studied animal physiology  anatomy  and behavior for divinatory purposes  and made extensive records of the movements of astronomical objects for their study of astrology   the mesopotamians had intense interest in medicine  and the earliest medical prescriptions appear in sumerian during the third dynasty of ur  bce bce  nonetheless the mesopotamians seem to have had little interest in gathering information about the natural world for the mere sake of gathering information  and mainly only studied scientific subjects which had obvious practical applications or immediate relevance to their religious system  history of science in classical antiquity nature philosophy in classical antiquity  there is no real ancient analog of a modern scientist  instead well-educated usually upper-class and almost universally male individuals performed various investigations into nature whenever they could afford the time  before the invention or discovery of the concept of  nature   ancient greek phusis  by the pre-socratic philosophers  the same words tend to be used to describe the way in which a plant grows  and the way in which for example one tribe worships a particular god for this reason it is claimed these men were the first philosophers in the strict sense and also the first people to clearly distinguish nature and convention  natural philosophy  the precursor of natural science  was thereby distinguished as the knowledge of nature and things which are true for every community and the name of the specialized pursuit of such knowledge was philosophy the realm of the first philosopher-physicists they were mainly speculators or theorists  particularly interested in astronomy  in contrast trying to use knowledge of nature to imitate nature artifice or technology  greek  was seen by classical scientists as a more appropriate interest for artisans of lower social class   aristotle ptolemy peter apian  the early greek philosophers of the milesian school  which was founded by thales of miletus and later continued by his successors anaximander and anaximenes  were the first to attempt to explain natural phenomena without relying on the supernatural   the pythagoreans developed a complex number philosophy  and contributed significantly to the development of mathematical science  the theory of atoms was developed by the greek philosopher leucippus and his student democritus    the greek doctor hippocrates established the tradition of systematic medical science   and is known as  the father of medicine   a turning point in the history of early philosophical science was socrates  example of applying philosophy to the study of human matters including human nature the nature of political communities and human knowledge itself the socratic method as documented by plato dialogues is a dialectic method of hypothesis elimination better hypotheses are found by steadily identifying and eliminating those that lead to contradictions this was a reaction to the sophist emphasis on rhetoric  the socratic method es for general commonly held truths that shape beliefs and scrutinizes them to determine their consistency with other beliefs  socrates criticized the older type of study of physics as too purely speculative and lacking in self-criticism socrates was later in the words of his  accused of corrupting the youth of athens because he did not believe in the gods the state believes in but in other new spiritual beings socrates refuted these claims  but was sentenced to death  aristotle later created a systematic programme of teleological philosophy motion and change is described as the actualization of potentials already in things according to what types of things they are in his physics the sun goes around the earth and many things have it as part of their nature that they are for humans each thing has a formal cause  a final cause  and a role in a cosmic order with an unmoved mover  the socratics also insisted that philosophy should be used to consider the practical question of the best way to live for a human being a study aristotle divided into ethics and political philosophy  aristotle maintained that man knows a thing scientifically when he possesses a conviction arrived at in a certain way and when the first principles on which that conviction rests are known to him with certainty  the greek astronomer aristarchus of samos  bce was the first to propose a heliocentric model of the universe with the sun at the center and all the planets orbiting it  aristarchus model was widely rejected because it was believed to violate the laws of physics  the inventor and mathematician archimedes of syracuse made major contributions to the beginnings of calculus  and has sometimes been credited as its inventor  although his proto-calculus lacked several defining features  pliny the elder was a roman writer and polymath who wrote the seminal encyclopedia natural history     dealing with history geography medicine astronomy earth science botany and zoology  other scientists or proto-scientists in antiquity were theophrastus  euclid  herophilos  hipparchus  ptolemy  and galen  margarita philosophica ventricle common sense  forms sensory systems byzantine science science in the medieval islamic world european science in the middle ages because of the collapse of the western roman empire due to the migration period an intellectual decline took place in the western part of europe in the  in contrast the byzantine empire resisted the attacks from invaders and preserved and improved upon the learning john philoponus  a byzantine scholar in the  questioned aristotle teaching of physics noting its flaws  john philoponus criticism of aristotelian principles of physics served as an inspiration to medieval scholars as well as to galileo galilei who ten centuries later during the scientific revolution  extensively cited philoponus in his works while making the case for why aristotelian physics was flawed   during late antiquity and the early middle ages  the aristotelian approach to inquiries on natural phenomena was used aristotle four causes prescribed that the question why should be answered in four ways in order to explain things scientifically  some ancient knowledge was lost or in some cases kept in obscurity during the fall of the western roman empire and periodic political struggles however the general fields of science or  natural philosophy  as it was called and much of the general knowledge from the ancient world remained preserved through the works of the early latin encyclopedists like isidore of seville   however aristotle original texts were eventually lost in western europe and only one text by plato was widely known the timaeus  which was the only platonic dialogue and one of the few original works of classical natural philosophy available to latin readers in the early middle ages another original work that gained influence in this period was ptolemy almagest  which contains a geocentric description of the solar system during late antiquity in the byzantine empire many greek classical texts were preserved many syriac translations were done by groups such as the nestorians and monophysites  they played a role when they translated greek classical texts into arabic under the caliphate  during which many types of classical learning were preserved and in some cases improved upon  a in addition the neighboring sassanid empire established the medical academy of gondeshapur where greek syriac and persian physicians established the most important medical center of the ancient world during the and centuries  the house of wisdom was established in abbasid -era baghdad  iraq   where the islamic study of aristotelianism flourished al-kindi  was the first of the muslim peripatetic philosophers and is known for his efforts to introduce greek and hellenistic philosophy to the arab world   the islamic golden age flourished from this time until the mongol invasions of the century ibn al-haytham alhazen as well as his predecessor ibn sahl  was familiar with ptolemy optics  and used experiments as a means to gain knowledge b   alhazen disproved ptolemy theory of vision  but did not make any corresponding changes to aristotle metaphysics furthermore doctors and alchemists such as the persians avicenna and al-razi also greatly developed the science of medicine with the former writing the canon of medicine  a medical encyclopedia used until the century and the latter discovering multiple compounds like alcohol  avicenna canon is considered to be one of the most important publications in medicine and they both contributed significantly to the practice of experimental medicine using clinical trials and experiments to back their claims  in classical antiquity  greek and roman taboos had meant that dissection was usually banned in ancient times but in middle ages it changed medical teachers and students at bologna began to open human bodies and mondino de luzzi c  produced the rst known anatomy textbook based on human dissection   by the eleventh century most of europe had become christian stronger monarchies emerged borders were restored technological developments and agricultural innovations were made which increased the food supply and population in addition classical greek texts started to be translated from arabic and greek into latin giving a higher level of scientific discussion in western europe  by  the first university in europe the university of bologna  had emerged from its clerical beginnings demand for latin translations grew for example from the toledo school of translators  western europeans began collecting texts written not only in latin but also latin translations from greek arabic and hebrew manuscript copies of alhazen book of optics also propagated across europe before   as evidenced by its incorporation into vitello perspectiva  avicenna canon was translated into latin  in particular the texts of aristotle ptolemy  c and euclid  preserved in the houses of wisdom and also in the byzantine empire   were sought amongst catholic scholars the influx of ancient texts caused the renaissance of the century and the flourishing of a synthesis of catholicism and aristotelianism known as scholasticism in western europe  which became a new geographic center of science an in this period would be understood as a careful process of observing describing and classifying  one prominent scientist in this era was roger bacon  scholasticism had a strong focus on revelation and dialectic reasoning  and gradually fell out of favour over the next centuries as alchemy focus on experiments that include direct observation and meticulous documentation slowly increased in importance scientific revolution astronomy accurate tycho brahe scientific instruments celestial bodies brahe observations kepler laws new developments in optics played a role in the inception of the renaissance  both by challenging long-held metaphysical ideas on perception as well as by contributing to the improvement and development of technology such as the camera obscura and the telescope  before what we now know as the renaissance started roger bacon  vitello  and john peckham each built up a scholastic ontology upon a causal chain beginning with sensation perception and finally apperception of the individual and universal forms of aristotle  a model of vision later known as perspectivism was exploited and studied by the artists of the renaissance this theory uses only three of aristotle four causes  formal material and final  in the sixteenth century copernicus formulated a heliocentric model of the solar system unlike the geocentric model of ptolemy almagest  this was based on a theorem that the orbital periods of the planets are longer as their orbs are farther from the centre of motion which he found not to agree with ptolemy model  kepler and others challenged the notion that the only function of the eye is perception and shifted the main focus in optics from the eye to the propagation of light   kepler modelled the eye as a water-filled glass sphere with an aperture in front of it to model the entrance pupil he found that all the light from a single point of the scene was imaged at a single point at the back of the glass sphere the optical chain ends on the retina at the back of the eye d kepler is best known however for improving copernicus heliocentric model through the discovery of kepler laws of planetary motion  kepler did not reject aristotelian metaphysics and described his work as a  for the harmony of the spheres  galileo made innovative use of experiment and mathematics however he became persecuted after pope urban viii blessed galileo to write about the copernican system galileo had used arguments from the pope and put them in the voice of the simpleton in the work dialogue concerning the two chief world systems which greatly offended urban viii  in northern europe the new technology of the printing press was widely used to publish many arguments including some that disagreed widely with contemporary ideas of nature ren descartes and francis bacon published philosophical arguments in favor of a new type of non-aristotelian science descartes emphasized individual thought and argued that mathematics rather than geometry should be used in order to study nature bacon emphasized the importance of experiment over contemplation bacon further questioned the aristotelian concepts of formal cause and final cause and promoted the idea that science should study the laws of simple natures such as heat rather than assuming that there is any specific nature or  formal cause  of each complex type of thing this new science began to see itself as describing  laws of nature  this updated approach to studies in nature was seen as mechanistic  bacon also argued that science should aim for the first time at practical inventions for the improvement of all human life age of enlightenment isaac newton principia classical mechanics gravity optics gottfried leibniz as a precursor to the age of enlightenment  isaac newton and gottfried wilhelm leibniz succeeded in developing a new physics now referred to as classical mechanics  which could be confirmed by experiment and explained using mathematics newton  philosophi naturalis principia mathematica  leibniz also incorporated terms from aristotelian physics  but now being used in a new non-teleological way for example  energy  and  potential  modern versions of aristotelian  and  this implied a shift in the view of objects where aristotle had noted that objects have certain innate goals that can be actualized objects were now regarded as devoid of innate goals in the style of francis bacon leibniz assumed that different types of things all work according to the same general laws of nature with no special formal or final causes for each type of thing  it is during this period that the word science gradually became more commonly used to refer to a of a type of knowledge especially knowledge of nature coming close in meaning to the old term  natural philosophy  during this time the declared purpose and value of science became producing wealth and inventions that would improve human lives in the materialistic sense of having more food clothing and other things in bacon words  the real and legitimate goal of sciences is the endowment of human life with new inventions and riches and he discouraged scientists from pursuing intangible philosophical or spiritual ideas which he believed contributed little to human happiness beyond the fume of subtle sublime or pleasing speculation  science during the enlightenment was dominated by scientific societies  and academies  which had largely replaced universities as centres of scientific re and development societies and academies were also the backbones of the maturation of the scientific profession another important development was the popularization of science among an increasingly literate population philosophes introduced the public to many scientific theories most notably through the encyclopdie and the popularization of newtonianism by voltaire as well as by milie du chtelet the french translator of newton  some historians have marked the century as a drab period in the history of science   however the century saw significant advancements in the practice of medicine  mathematics  and physics  the development of biological taxonomy  a new understanding of magnetism and electricity  and the maturation of chemistry as a discipline which established the foundations of modern chemistry enlightenment philosophers chose a short history of scientific predecessors galileo  boyle  and newton principally as the guides and guarantors of their applications of the singular concept of nature and natural law to every physical and social field of the day in this respect the lessons of history and the social structures built upon it could be discarded  ideas on human nature society and economics also evolved during the enlightenment hume and other scottish enlightenment thinkers developed a  science of man   which was expressed historically in works by authors including james burnett  adam ferguson  john millar and william robertson  all of whom merged a scientific study of how humans behaved in ancient and primitive cultures with a strong awareness of the determining forces of modernity  modern sociology largely originated from this movement  in  adam smith published the wealth of nations  which is often considered the first work on modern economics  evolutionary tree charles darwin on the origin of species the nineteenth century is a particularly important period in the history of science since during this era many distinguishing characteristics of contemporary modern science began to take shape such as transformation of the life and physical sciences frequent use of precision instruments emergence of terms like biologist physicist scientist slowly moving away from antiquated labels like natural philosophy and  natural history  increased professionalization of those studying nature lead to reduction in amateur naturalists scientists gained cultural authority over many dimensions of society economic expansion and industrialization of numerous countries thriving of popular science writings and emergence of science journals  early in the century john dalton suggested the modern atomic theory  based on democritus original idea of indivisible particles called  both john herschel and william whewell systematized methodology the latter coined the term scientist   during the mid- century charles darwin and alfred russel wallace independently proposed the theory of evolution by natural selection in  which explained how different plants and animals originated and evolved their theory was set out in detail in darwin book on the origin of species  which was published in   separately gregor mendel presented his paper    experiments on plant hybridization  in   which outlined the principles of biological inheritance serving as the basis for modern genetics  the laws of conservation of energy  conservation of momentum and conservation of mass suggested a highly stable universe where there could be little loss of resources with the advent of the steam engine and the industrial revolution  there was however an increased understanding that all forms of energy as defined in physics were not equally useful they did not have the same energy quality  this realization led to the development of the laws of thermodynamics  in which the free energy of the universe is seen as constantly declining the entropy of a closed universe increases over time the electromagnetic theory was also established in the century by the works of hans christian rsted  andr-marie ampre  michael faraday  james clerk maxwell  oliver heaviside  and heinrich hertz  the new theory raised questions that could not easily be answered using newton framework the phenomena that would allow the deconstruction of the atom were discovered in the last decade of the century the discovery of x-rays inspired the discovery of radioactivity  in the next year came the discovery of the first subatomic particle the electron  during the late century psychology emerged as a separate discipline from philosophy when wilhelm wundt founded the first laboratory for psychological re in   dna double helix molecule genetic organisms viruses albert einstein theory of relativity and the development of quantum mechanics led to the replacement of classical mechanics with a new physics which contains two parts that describe different types of events in nature in the first half of the century the development of antibiotics and artificial fertilizers made global human population growth possible at the same time the structure of the atom and its nucleus was discovered leading to the release of  atomic energy   nuclear power  in addition the extensive use of technological innovation stimulated by the wars of this century led to revolutions in transportation  automobiles and aircraft  the development of icbms  a space race  and a nuclear arms race  evolution became a unified theory in the early -century when the modern synthesis reconciled darwinian evolution with classical genetics   the molecular structure of dna was discovered by james watson and francis crick in  the discovery of the cosmic microwave background radiation in led to a rejection of the steady state theory of the universe in favor of the big bang theory of georges lematre  the development of spaceflight in the second half of the century allowed the first astronomical measurements done on or near other objects in space including six manned landings on the moon  space telescopes lead to numerous discoveries in astronomy and cosmology widespread use of integrated circuits in the last quarter of the century combined with communications satellites led to a revolution in information technology and the rise of the global internet and mobile computing  including smartphones  the need for mass systematization of long intertwined causal chains and large amounts of data led to the rise of the fields of systems theory and computer-assisted scientific modelling  which are partly based on the aristotelian paradigm  harmful environmental issues such as ozone depletion  acidification  eutrophication and climate change came to the public attention in the same period and caused the onset of environmental science and environmental technology  large hadron collider higgs boson the human genome project was completed in  determining the sequence of nucleotide base pairs that make up human dna and identifying and mapping all of the genes of the human genome  induced pluripotent stem cells were developed in  a technology allowing adult cells to be transformed into stem cells capable of giving rise to any cell type found in the body potentially of huge importance to the field of regenerative medicine   with the discovery of the higgs boson in  the last particle predicted by the standard model of particle physics was found in  gravitational waves  predicted by general relativity a century before were first observed    branches of science hierarchy of the sciences modern science is commonly divided into three major branches  natural science  social science  and formal science   each of these branches comprises various specialized yet overlapping scientific disciplines that often possess their own nomenclature and expertise  both natural and social sciences are empirical sciences   as their knowledge is based on empirical observations and is capable of being tested for its validity by other reers working under the same conditions  there are also closely related disciplines that use science such as engineering and medicine  which are sometimes described as applied sciences  the relationships between the branches of science are summarized by the following table empirical sciences formal science natural science social science basic physics chemistry biology earth science space science anthropology economics political science human geography psychology sociology logic mathematics statistics applied engineering agricultural science medicine materials science business administration public policy marketing law pedagogy international development computer science natural science outline of natural science natural science is the study of the physical world it can be divided into two main branches life science or biological science and physical science  these two branches may be further divided into more specialized disciplines for example physical science can be subdivided into physics  chemistry  astronomy  and earth science  modern natural science is the successor to the natural philosophy that began in ancient greece  galileo  descartes  bacon  and newton debated the benefits of using approaches which were more mathematical and more experimental in a methodical way still philosophical perspectives conjectures  and presuppositions  often overlooked remain necessary in natural science  systematic data collection including discovery science  succeeded natural history  which emerged in the century by describing and classifying plants animals minerals and so on  today natural history suggests observational descriptions aimed at popular audiences  social science outline of social science economics supply and demand market economy social science is the study of human behavior and functioning of societies   it has many disciplines that include but are not limited to anthropology  economics  history  human geography  political science  psychology  and sociology   in the social sciences there are many competing theoretical perspectives many of which are extended through competing re programs such as the functionalists  conflict theorists  and interactionists in sociology  due to the limitations of conducting controlled experiments involving large groups of individuals or complex situations social scientists may adopt other re methods such as the historical method  case studies  and cross-cultural studies  moreover if quantitative information is available social scientists may rely on statistical approaches to better understand social relationships and processes  formal science outline of formal science formal science is an area of study that generates knowledge using formal systems     it includes mathematics    systems theory  and theoretical computer science  the formal sciences share similarities with the other two branches by relying on objective careful and systematic study of an area of knowledge they are however different from the empirical sciences as they rely exclusively on deductive reasoning without the need for empirical evidence  to verify their abstract concepts    the formal sciences are therefore disciplines and because of this there is disagreement on whether they actually constitute a science   nevertheless the formal sciences play an important role in the empirical sciences calculus  for example was initially invented to understand motion in physics  natural and social sciences that rely heavily on mathematical applications include mathematical physics  mathematical chemistry  mathematical biology  mathematical finance  and mathematical economics  applied science outline of applied science louis pasteur pasteurization vaccination fermentation applied science is the use of the scientific method and knowledge to attain practical goals and includes a broad range of disciplines such as engineering and medicine       engineering is the use of scientific principles to design and build machines structures and other items including bridges tunnels roads vehicles and buildings  engineering itself encompasses a range of more specialized fields of engineering  each with a more specific emphasis on particular areas of applied mathematics  science and types of application medicine is the practice of caring for patients by maintaining and restoring health through the prevention  diagnosis  and treatment of injury or disease      contemporary medicine applies biomedical sciences  medical re  genetics  and medical technology to prevent diagnose and treat injury and disease typically through the use of medications  medical devices  surgery  and non-pharmacological interventions  the applied sciences are often contrasted with the basic sciences  which are focused on advancing scientific theories and laws that explain and predict events in the natural world re scientific re can be labeled as either basic or applied re basic re is the  for knowledge and applied re is the  for solutions to practical problems using this knowledge although some scientific re is applied re into specific problems a great deal of our understanding comes from the curiosity-driven undertaking of basic re  this leads to options for technological advances that were not planned or sometimes even imaginable this point was made by michael faraday when allegedly in response to the question what is the of basic re he responded sir what is the use of a new-born child  for example re into the effects of red light on the human eye rod cells did not seem to have any practical purpose eventually the discovery that our night vision is not troubled by red light would lead  and rescue teams among others to adopt red light in the cockpits of jets and helicopters  finally even basic re can take unexpected turns and there is some sense in which the scientific method is built to harness luck  scientific method scientific method aristotle galileo  scientific re involves using the scientific method  which seeks to objectively explain the events of nature in a reproducible way  an explanatory thought experiment or hypothesis is put forward as explanation using principles such as parsimony also known as  occam razor  and are generally expected to seek consilience fitting well with other accepted facts related to the phenomena  this new explanation is used to make falsifiable predictions that are testable by experiment or observation the predictions are to be posted before a confirming experiment or observation is sought as proof that no tampering has occurred disproof of a prediction is evidence of progress e f   this is done partly through observation of natural phenomena but also through experimentation that tries to simulate natural events under controlled conditions as appropriate to the discipline in the observational sciences such as astronomy or geology a predicted observation might take the place of a controlled experiment experimentation is especially important in science to help establish causal relationships to avoid the correlation fallacy  when a hypothesis proves unsatisfactory it is either modified or discarded  if the hypothesis survived testing it may become adopted into the framework of a scientific theory  a logically reasoned self-consistent model or framework for describing the behavior of certain natural phenomena a theory typically describes the behavior of much broader sets of phenomena than a hypothesis commonly a large number of hypotheses can be logically bound together by a single theory thus a theory is a hypothesis explaining various other hypotheses in that vein theories are formulated according to most of the same scientific principles as hypotheses in addition to testing hypotheses scientists may also generate a model  an attempt to describe or depict the phenomenon in terms of a logical physical or mathematical representation and to generate new hypotheses that can be tested based on observable phenomena  while performing experiments to test hypotheses scientists may have a preference for one outcome over another and so it is important to ensure that science as a whole can eliminate this bias   this can be achieved by careful experimental design  transparency and a thorough peer review process of the experimental results as well as any conclusions   after the results of an experiment are announced or published it is normal practice for independent reers to double-check how the re was performed and to follow up by performing similar experiments to determine how dependable the results might be  taken in its entirety the scientific method allows for highly creative problem solving while minimizing any effects of subjective bias on the part of its users especially the confirmation bias   john ziman points out that intersubjective verifiability is fundamental to the creation of all scientific knowledge  ziman shows how scientists can identify patterns to each other across centuries he refers to this ability as perceptual consensibility  he then makes consensibility leading to consensus the touchstone of reliable knowledge  mathematics formal science mathematics is essential in the formation of hypotheses  theories  and laws  in the natural and social sciences for example it is used in quantitative scientific modeling  which can generate new hypotheses and predictions to be tested it is also used extensively in observing and collecting measurements  statistics  a branch of mathematics is used to summarize and analyze data which allow scientists to assess the reliability and variability of their experimental results computational science applies computing power to simulate real-world situations enabling a better understanding of scientific problems than formal mathematics alone can achieve according to the society for industrial and applied mathematics  computation is now as important as theory and experiment in advancing scientific knowledge  philosophy of science scientists usually take for granted a set of basic assumptions that are needed to justify the scientific method  that there is an objective reality shared by all rational observers  that this objective reality is governed by natural laws   that these laws can be discovered by means of systematic observation and experimentation   the philosophy of science seeks a deep understanding of what these underlying assumptions mean and whether they are valid the belief that scientific theories should and do represent metaphysical reality is known as realism  it can be contrasted with anti-realism  the view that the success of science does not depend on it being accurate about unobservable entities such as electrons  one form of anti-realism is idealism  the belief that the mind or consciousness is the most basic essence and that each mind generates its own reality g in an idealistic world view  what is true for one mind need not be true for other minds there are different schools of thought in the philosophy of science the most popular position is empiricism  h which holds that knowledge is created by a process involving observation and that scientific theories are the result of generalizations from such observations  empiricism generally encompasses inductivism  a position that tries to explain the way general theories can be justified by the finite number of observations humans can make and hence the finite amount of empirical evidence available to confirm scientific theories this is necessary because the number of predictions those theories make is infinite which means that they cannot be known from the finite amount of evidence using deductive logic only many versions of empiricism exist with the predominant ones being bayesianism  and the hypothetico-deductive method   the horse in motion flying gallop karl popper empirical falsification conjecture and refutation empiricism has stood in contrast to rationalism  the position originally associated with descartes  which holds that knowledge is created by the human intellect not by observation  critical rationalism is a contrasting -century approach to science first defined by austrian-british philosopher karl popper  popper rejected the way that empiricism describes the connection between theory and observation he claimed that theories are not generated by observation but that observation is made in the light of theories and that the only way a theory can be affected by observation is when it comes in conflict with it  popper proposed replacing verifiability with falsifiability as the landmark of scientific theories and replacing induction with falsification as the empirical method  popper further claimed that there is actually only one universal method not specific to science the negative method of criticism trial and error   it covers all products of the human mind including science mathematics philosophy and art  another approach instrumentalism  emphasizes the utility of theories as instruments for explaining and predicting phenomena  it views scientific theories as black boxes with only their input initial conditions and output predictions being relevant consequences theoretical entities and logical structure are claimed to be something that should simply be ignored and that scientists should not make a fuss about see interpretations of quantum mechanics  close to instrumentalism is constructive empiricism  according to which the main criterion for the success of a scientific theory is whether what it says about observable entities is true kuhn epicycles copernican revolution thomas kuhn argued that the process of observation and evaluation takes place within a paradigm a logically consistent portrait of the world that is consistent with observations made from its framing he characterized as the process of observation and puzzle solving which takes place within a paradigm whereas occurs when one paradigm overtakes another in a paradigm shift   each paradigm has its own distinct questions aims and interpretations the choice between paradigms involves setting two or more portraits against the world and deciding which likeness is most promising a paradigm shift occurs when a significant number of observational anomalies arise in the old paradigm and a new paradigm makes sense of them that is the choice of a new paradigm is based on observations even though those observations are made against the background of the old paradigm for kuhn acceptance or rejection of a paradigm is a social process as much as a logical process kuhn position however is not one of relativism   finally another approach often cited in debates of scientific skepticism against controversial movements like  creation science  is methodological naturalism  its main point is that a difference between natural and supernatural explanations should be made and that science should be restricted methodologically to natural explanations  i that the restriction is merely methodological rather than ontological means that science should not consider supernatural explanations itself but should not claim them to be wrong either instead supernatural explanations should be left a matter of personal belief outside the scope of science  methodological naturalism maintains that proper science requires strict adherence to empirical study and independent verification as a process for properly developing and evaluating explanations for observable phenomena  the absence of these standards arguments from authority  biased observational studies and other common fallacies are frequently cited by supporters of methodological naturalism as characteristic of the non-science they criticize a scientific theory is empirical h  and is always open to falsification if new evidence is presented that is no theory is ever considered strictly certain as science accepts the concept of fallibilism  j the philosopher of science karl popper sharply distinguished truth from certainty he wrote that scientific knowledge consists in the  for truth but it is not the  for certainty all human knowledge is fallible and therefore uncertain  new scientific knowledge rarely results in vast changes in our understanding according to psychologist keith stanovich  it may be the media overuse of words like breakthrough that leads the public to imagine that science is constantly proving everything it thought was true to be false  while there are such famous cases as the theory of relativity that required a complete reconceptualization these are extreme exceptions knowledge in science is gained by a gradual synthesis of information from different experiments by various reers across different branches of science it is more like a climb than a leap  theories vary in the extent to which they have been tested and verified as well as their acceptance in the scientific community k for example heliocentric theory  the theory of evolution  relativity theory  and germ theory still bear the name theory even though in practice they are considered factual   philosopher barry stroud adds that although the best definition for  knowledge  is contested being skeptical and entertaining the that one is incorrect is compatible with being correct therefore scientists adhering to proper scientific approaches will doubt themselves even once they possess the truth   the fallibilist cs peirce argued that inquiry is the struggle to resolve actual doubt and that merely quarrelsome verbal or hyperbolic doubt is fruitless  but also that the inquirer should try to attain genuine doubt rather than resting uncritically on common sense  he held that the successful sciences trust not to any single chain of inference no stronger than its weakest link but to the cable of multiple and various arguments intimately connected  stanovich also asserts that science avoids ing for a magic bullet it avoids the single-cause fallacy  this means a scientist would not ask merely what is cause of but rather what the most significant of this is especially the case in the more macroscopic fields of science eg psychology  physical cosmology   re often analyzes few factors at once but these are always added to the long list of factors that are most important to consider  for example knowing the details of only a person genetics or their history and upbringing or the current situation may not explain a behavior but a deep understanding of all these variables combined can be very predictive scientific literature science scientific re is published in an enormous range of scientific literature   scientific journals communicate and document the results of re carried out in universities and various other re institutions serving as an archival record of science the first scientific journals journal des savans followed by the philosophical transactions  began publication in  since that time the total number of active periodicals has steadily increased in  one estimate for the number of scientific and technical journals in publication was   the united states national library of medicine currently indexes  journals that contain articles on topics related to the life sciences although the journals are in languages percent of the indexed articles are published in english  most scientific journals cover a single scientific field and publish the re within that field the re is normally expressed in the form of a scientific paper  science has become so pervasive in modern societies that it is generally considered necessary to communicate the achievements news and ambitions of scientists to a wider populace science magazines such as new scientist  science  vie  and scientific american cater to the needs of a much wider readership and provide a non-technical summary of popular areas of re including notable discoveries and advances in certain fields of re science books engage the interest of many more people tangentially the science fiction genre primarily fantastic in nature engages the public imagination and transmits the ideas if not the methods of science recent efforts to intensify or develop links between science and non-scientific disciplines such as literature or more specifically poetry  include the resource developed through the royal literary fund   discoveries in fundamental science can be world-changing for example static electricity

penicillin doxycycline nuclear magnetic resonance nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy magnetic resonance imaging functional magnetic resonance imaging replication crisis metascience the replication crisis is an ongoing methodological crisis primarily affecting parts of the social and life sciences in which scholars have found that the results of many scientific studies are difficult or impossible to replicate or reproduce on subsequent investigation either by independent reers or by the original reers themselves   the crisis has long-standing roots the phrase was coined in the early  as part of a growing awareness of the problem the replication crisis represents an important body of re in metascience  which aims to improve the quality of all scientific re while reducing waste  an area of study or speculation that masquerades as science in an attempt to claim a legitimacy that it would not otherwise be able to achieve is sometimes referred to as pseudoscience  fringe science  or junk science  m physicist richard feynman coined the term  cargo cult science  for cases in which reers believe they are ng science because their activities have the outward appearance of science but actually lack the kind of utter honesty that allows their results to be rigorously evaluated  various types of commercial advertising ranging from hype to fraud may fall into these categories science has been described as the most important tool for separating valid claims from invalid ones  there can also be an element of political or ideological bias on all sides of scientific debates sometimes re may be characterized as bad science re that may be well-intended but is actually incorrect obsolete incomplete or over-simplified expositions of scientific ideas the term  scientific misconduct  refers to situations such as where reers have intentionally misrepresented their published data or have purposely given credit for a discovery to the wrong person  scientific community the scientific community is a group of all interacting scientists along with their respective societies and institutions scientist albert einstein theory of relativity nobel prize in physics photoelectric effect scientists are individuals who conduct scientific re to advance knowledge in an area of interest   the term was coined by william whewell in  in modern times many professional scientists are trained in an academic setting and upon completion attain an academic degree  with the highest degree being a doctorate such as a doctor of philosophy phd  many scientists pursue careers in various sectors of the economy such as academia  industry  government  and nonprofit organizations     scientists exhibit a strong curiosity about reality  with some scientists having a desire to apply scientific knowledge for the benefit of health nations environment or industries other motivations include recognition by their peers and prestige the nobel prize  a widely regarded prestigious award  is awarded annually to those who have achieved scientific advances in the fields of medicine  physics  chemistry  and economics  women in science women in stem fields marie curie nobel prizes physics chemistry  science has historically been a male-dominated field with some notable exceptions n women faced considerable discrimination in science much as they did in other areas of male-dominated societies such as frequently being passed over for job opportunities and denied credit for their work o for example christine ladd  was able to enter a phd program as c ladd christine kitty ladd completed the requirements in  but was awarded her degree only in  after a career which spanned the algebra of logic see truth table  color vision and psychology her work preceded notable reers like ludwig wittgenstein and charles sanders peirce  the achievements of women in science have been attributed to the defiance of their traditional role as laborers within the domestic sphere   in the late century active recruitment of women and elimination of institutional discrimination on the basis of sex greatly increased the number of women scientists but large gender disparities remain in some fields in the early century over half of the new biologists were female while  of phds in physics are given to men in the early part of the century women in the united states earned  of bachelor degrees  of master degrees and  of phds in science and engineering fields they earned more than half of the degrees in psychology about  social sciences about  and biology about  but earned less than half the degrees in the physical sciences earth sciences mathematics engineering and computer science  lifestyle choice also plays a major role in female engagement in science women with young children are  less likely to take tenure-track positions due to work-life balance issues  and female graduate students interest in careers in re declines dramatically over the course of graduate school whereas that of their male colleagues remains unchanged  learned society royal society learned societies for the communication and promotion of scientific thought and experimentation have existed since the renaissance   many scientists belong to a learned society that promotes their respective scientific discipline  profession  or group of related disciplines  membership may be open to all may require possession of some scientific credentials or may be an honor conferred by election  most scientific societies are non-profit organizations  and many are professional associations  their activities typically include holding regular conferences for the presentation and discussion of new re results and publishing or sponsoring academic journals in their discipline some also act as professional bodies  regulating the activities of their members in the public interest or the collective interest of the membership scholars in the sociology of science argue that learned societies are of key importance and their formation assists in the emergence and development of new disciplines or professions the professionalization of science begun in the century was partly enabled by the creation of distinguished academy of sciences in a number of countries such as the italian accademia dei lincei in   the british royal society in  the french acadmie des sciences in   the american national academy of sciences in  the german kaiser wilhelm institute in  and the chinese academy of sciences in  international scientific organizations such as the international council for science  have since been formed to promote cooperation between the scientific communities of different nations science  society sociology of scientific knowledge science policy history of science policy economics of science science policy is an area of public policy concerned with the policies that affect the conduct of the scientific enterprise including re funding  often in pursuance of other national policy goals such as technological innovation to promote commercial product development weapons development health care and environmental monitoring science policy also refers to the act of applying scientific knowledge and consensus to the development of public policies science policy thus deals with the entire domain of issues that involve the natural sciences in accordance with public policy being concerned about the well-being of its citizens science policy goal is to consider how science and technology can best serve the public state policy has influenced the funding of public works and science for thousands of years particularly within civilizations with highly organized governments such as imperial china and the roman empire  prominent historical examples include the great wall of china  completed over the course of two millennia through the state support of several dynasties  and the grand canal of the yangtze river  an immense feat of hydraulic engineering begun by sunshu ao  c bce ximen bao  cbce and shi chi  c bce this construction dates from the century bce under the sui dynasty and is still in use today in china such state-supported infrastructure and scientific re projects date at least from the time of the mohists  who inspired the study of logic during the period of the hundred schools of thought and the study of defensive fortifications like the great wall of china during the warring states period  public policy can directly affect the funding of capital equipment and intellectual infrastructure for industrial re by providing tax incentives to those organizations that fund re vannevar bush  director of the office of scientific re and development for the united states government the forerunner of the national science foundation  wrote in july that science is a proper concern of government  funding of science commonwealth scientific and industrial re organisation scientific re is often funded through a competitive process in which potential re projects are evaluated and only the most promising receive funding such processes which are run by government corporations or foundations allocate scarce funds total re funding in most developed countries is between  and  of gdp   in the oecd  around two-thirds of re and development in scientific and technical fields is carried out by industry and  and  respectively by universities and government the government funding proportion in certain industries is higher and it dominates re in social science and humanities  similarly with some exceptions eg biotechnology  government provides the bulk of the funds for basic scientific re  many governments have dedicated agencies to support scientific re prominent scientific organizations include the national science foundation in the united states  the national scientific and technical re council in argentina commonwealth scientific and industrial re organisation csiro in australia centre national de la recherche scientifique in france the max planck society and deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft in germany and csic in spain in commercial re and development all but the most re-oriented corporations focus more heavily on near-term commercialisation possibilities rather than  blue-sky  ideas or technologies such as nuclear fusion  public awareness of science science outreach science communication houston museum of natural science the public awareness of science relates to the attitudes behaviors opinions and activities that make up the relations between science and the general public it integrates various themes and activities such as science communication  science museums  science festivals  science fairs  citizen science  and science in popular culture  social scientists have devised various metrics to measure the public understanding of science such as factual knowledge self-reported knowledge and structural knowledge   science journalism the mass media face a number of pressures that can prevent them from accurately depicting competing scientific claims in terms of their credibility within the scientific community as a whole determining how much weight to give different sides in a scientific debate may require considerable expertise regarding the matter  few journalists have real scientific knowledge and even beat reporters who know a great deal about certain scientific issues may be ignorant about other scientific issues that they are suddenly asked to cover   politicization of science academic studies of scientific agreement on human-caused global warming   political controversy over this issue united states politicization of science occurs when government  business  or advocacy groups use legal or economic pressure to influence the findings of scientific re or the way it is disseminated reported or interpreted many factors can act as facets of the politicization of science such as populist anti-intellectualism  perceived threats to religious beliefs postmodernist subjectivism  and fear for business interests  politicization of science is usually accomplished when scientific information is presented in a way that emphasizes the uncertainty associated with the scientific evidence  tactics such as shifting conversation failing to acknowledge facts and capitalizing on doubt of scientific consensus have been used to gain more attention for views that have been undermined by scientific evidence  examples of issues that have involved the politicization of science include the global warming controversy

disambiguation natural disambiguation shaki waterfall armenia bachalpsee swiss alps lapland finland lightning galunggung volcano west java nature  in the broadest sense is the natural physical material world or universe  nature can refer to the phenomena of the physical world and also to life in general the study of nature is a large if not the only part of science  although humans are part of nature human activity is often understood as a separate category from other natural phenomena  the word is borrowed from the old french and is derived from the latin word  or essential qualities innate disposition and in ancient times literally meant birth  in ancient philosophy is mostly used as the latin translation of the greek word physis  which originally related to the intrinsic characteristics that plants animals and other features of the world develop of their own accord   the concept of nature as a whole the physical universe  is one of several expansions of the original notion  it began with certain core applications of the word by pre-socratic philosophers though this word had a dynamic dimension then especially for heraclitus  and has steadily gained currency ever since during the advent of modern scientific method in the last several centuries nature became the passive reality organized and moved by divine laws   with the industrial revolution  nature increasingly became seen as the part of reality deprived from intentional intervention it was hence considered as sacred by some traditions  rousseau  american transcendentalism  or a mere decorum for divine providence or human history  hegel  marx  however a vitalist vision of nature closer to the presocratic one got reborn at the same time especially after charles darwin   within the various uses of the word today nature often refers to geology and wildlife  nature can refer to the general realm of living plants and animals and in some cases to the processes associated with inanimate objectsthe way that particular types of things exist and change of their own accord such as the weather and geology of the earth  it is often taken to mean the  natural environment  or wilderness wild animals rocks forest and in general those things that have not been substantially altered by human intervention or which persist despite human intervention for example manufactured objects and human interaction generally are not considered part of nature unless qualified as for example human nature or the whole of nature this more traditional concept of natural things that can still be found today implies a distinction between the natural and the artificial with the artificial being understood as that which has been brought into being by a human consciousness or a human mind  depending on the particular context the term natural might also be distinguished from the unnatural or the supernatural   contents nature timeline single-celled life photosynthesis multicellular life earliest

oxygen earliest multicellular life earliest fungi sexual reproduction earliest animals plants cambrian explosion earliest mammals earliest apes humans l i f e billion years ago earth earth science the blue marble earth apollo earth is the only planet known to support life and its natural features are the subject of many fields of scientific re within the solar system  it is third closest to the sun it is the largest terrestrial planet and the fifth largest overall its most prominent climatic features are its two large polar regions two relatively narrow temperate zones and a wide equatorial tropical to subtropical region  precipitation varies widely with location from several metres of water per year to less than a millimetre percent of the earth surface is covered by salt-water oceans the remainder consists of continents and islands with most of the inhabited land in the northern hemisphere  earth has evolved through geological and biological processes that have left traces of the original conditions the outer surface is divided into several gradually migrating tectonic plates  the interior remains active with a thick layer of plastic mantle and an iron-filled core that generates a magnetic field  this iron core is composed of a solid inner phase and a fluid outer phase convective motion in the core generates electric currents through dynamo action and these in turn generate the geomagnetic field the atmospheric conditions have been significantly altered from the original conditions by the presence of life-forms  which create an ecological balance that stabilizes the surface conditions despite the wide regional variations in climate by latitude and other geographic factors the long-term average global climate is quite stable during interglacial periods  and variations of a degree or two of average global temperature have historically had major effects on the ecological balance and on the actual geography of the earth   geology geology is the science and study of the solid and liquid matter that constitutes the earth the field of geology encompasses the study of the composition structure  physical properties  dynamics and history of earth materials  and the processes by which they are formed moved and changed the field is a major academic discipline  and is also important for mineral and hydrocarbon extraction knowledge about and mitigation of natural hazards  some geotechnical engineering fields and understanding past climates and environments plate tectonic the geology of an area evolves through time as rock units are deposited and inserted and deformational processes change their shapes and locations rock units are first emplaced either by deposition onto the surface or intrude into the overlying rock  deposition can occur when sediments settle onto the surface of the earth and later lithify into sedimentary rock  or when as volcanic material such as volcanic ash or lava flows blanket the surface igneous intrusions such as batholiths  laccoliths  dikes  and sills  push upwards into the overlying rock and crystallize as they intrude after the initial sequence of rocks has been deposited the rock units can be deformed andor metamorphosed  deformation typically occurs as a result of horizontal shortening horizontal extension  or side-to-side  strike-slip  motion these structural regimes broadly relate to convergent boundaries  divergent boundaries  and transform boundaries  respectively between tectonic plates  history of the earth evolution pangaea earth is estimated to have formed  years ago from the solar nebula  along with the sun and other planets   the moon formed roughly years later initially molten the outer layer of the earth cooled resulting in the solid crust outgassing and volcanic activity produced the primordial atmosphere condensing water vapor  most or all of which came from ice delivered by comets  produced the oceans and other water sources  the highly energetic chemistry is believed to have produced a self-replicating molecule around years ago  plankton  continents formed then broke up and reformed as the surface of earth reshaped over hundreds of millions of years occasionally combining to make a supercontinent  roughly years ago the earliest known supercontinent rodinia  began to break apart the continents later recombined to form pannotia which broke apart about years ago then finally pangaea  which broke apart about years ago  during the neoproterozoic era freezing temperatures covered much of the earth in glaciers and ice sheets this hypothesis has been termed the  snowball earth  and it is of particular interest as it precedes the cambrian explosion in which multicellular life forms began to proliferate about years ago  since the cambrian explosion there have been five distinctly identifiable mass extinctions   the last mass extinction occurred some million years ago when a meteorite collision probably triggered the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs and other large reptiles but spared small animals such as mammals  over the past years mammalian life diversified  several million years ago a species of small african ape gained the ability to stand upright  the subsequent advent of human life and the development of agriculture and further civilization allowed humans to affect the earth more rapidly than any previous life form affecting both the nature and quantity of other organisms as well as global climate by comparison the great oxygenation event  produced by the proliferation of algae during the siderian period required about years to culminate the present era is classified as part of a mass extinction event  the holocene extinction event the fastest ever to have occurred   some such as e o wilson of harvard university  predict that human destruction of the biosphere could cause the extinction of one-half of all species in the next   the extent of the current extinction event is still being reed debated and calculated by biologists    blue light is scattered more atmosphere halo atmosphere of earth climate weather the earth atmosphere is a key factor in sustaining the ecosystem  the thin layer of gases that envelops the earth is held in place by gravity air is mostly nitrogen  oxygen  water vapor  with much smaller amounts of carbon dioxide argon etc the atmospheric pressure declines steadily with altitude the ozone layer plays an important role in depleting the amount of ultraviolet uv radiation that reaches the surface as dna is readily damaged by uv light this serves to protect life at the surface the atmosphere also retains heat during the night thereby reducing the daily temperature extremes terrestrial weather occurs almost exclusively in the lower part of the atmosphere  and serves as a convective system for redistributing heat  ocean currents are another important factor in determining climate particularly the major underwater thermohaline circulation which distributes heat energy from the equatorial oceans to the polar regions these currents help to moderate the differences in temperature between winter and summer in the temperate zones also without the redistributions of heat energy by the ocean currents and atmosphere the tropics would be much hotter and the polar regions much colder lightning weather can have both beneficial and harmful effects extremes in weather such as tornadoes or hurricanes and cyclones  can expend large amounts of energy along their paths and produce devastation surface vegetation has evolved a dependence on the seasonal variation of the weather and sudden changes lasting only a few years can have a dramatic effect both on the vegetation and on the animals which depend on its growth for their food climate is a measure of the long-term trends in the weather various factors are known to influence the climate  including ocean currents surface albedo  greenhouse gases  variations in the solar luminosity and changes to the earth orbit based on historical records the earth is known to have undergone drastic climate changes in the past including ice ages  oklahoma the climate of a region depends on a number of factors especially latitude  a latitudinal band of the surface with similar climatic attributes forms a climate region there are a number of such regions ranging from the tropical climate at the equator to the polar climate in the northern and southern extremes weather is also influenced by the seasons which result from the earth axis being tilted relative to its orbital plane  thus at any given time during the summer or winter one part of the earth is more directly exposed to the rays of the sun  this exposure alternates as the earth revolves in its orbit at any given time regardless of season the northern and southern hemispheres experience opposite seasons weather is a chaotic system that is readily modified by small changes to the environment  so accurate weather forecasting is limited to only a few days  overall two things are happening worldwide  temperature is increasing on the average and  regional climates have been undergoing noticeable changes  iguazu falls brazil argentina water water is a chemical substance that is composed of hydrogen and oxygen  and is vital for all known forms of life  in typical usage refers only to its liquid form or state  but the substance also has a solid state ice  and a gaseous state water vapor  or steam  water covers  of the earth surface  on earth it is found mostly in oceans and other large bodies of water with  of water below ground in aquifers and  in the air as vapor  clouds and precipitation    oceans hold  of surface water glaciers  and polar ice caps  and other land surface water such as rivers lakes and ponds  additionally a minute amount of the earth water is contained within biological bodies and manufactured products leblon ocean an ocean is a major body of saline water  and a principal component of the hydrosphere approximately  of the earth surface an area of some million square kilometers is covered by ocean a continuous body of water that is customarily divided into several principal oceans and smaller seas more than half of this area is over  meters  feet deep average oceanic salinity is around parts per thousand ppt  and nearly all seawater has a salinity in the range of to ppt though generally recognized as several  oceans these waters comprise one global interconnected body of salt water often referred to as the world ocean or global ocean   this concept of a global ocean as a continuous body of water with relatively free interchange among its parts is of fundamental importance to oceanography   the major oceanic divisions are defined in part by the continents  various archipelagos  and other criteria these divisions are in descending order of size the pacific ocean  the atlantic ocean  the indian ocean  the southern ocean  and the arctic ocean  smaller regions of the oceans are called seas gulfs bays and other names there are also salt lakes  which are smaller bodies of landlocked saltwater that are not interconnected with the world ocean two notable examples of salt lakes are the aral sea and the great salt lake  lake mapourika lake a lake from latin word  is a terrain feature or physical feature  a body of liquid on the surface of a world that is localized to the bottom of basin another type of landform or terrain feature that is it is not global and moves slowly if it moves at all on earth a body of water is considered a lake when it is inland not part of the ocean is larger and deeper than a pond and is fed by a river   the only world other than earth known to harbor lakes is titan  saturn largest moon which has lakes of ethane  most likely mixed with methane  it is not known if titan lakes are fed by rivers though titan surface is carved by numerous river beds natural lakes on earth are generally found in mountainous areas rift zones  and areas with ongoing or recent glaciation  other lakes are found in endorheic basins or along the courses of mature rivers in some parts of the world there are many lakes because of chaotic drainage patterns left over from the last ice age  all lakes are temporary over geologic time scales as they will slowly fill in with sediments or spill out of the basin containing them westborough massachusetts pond a pond is a body of standing water  either natural or man-made that is usually smaller than a lake a wide variety of man-made bodies of water are classified as ponds including water gardens designed for aesthetic ornamentation fish ponds designed for commercial fish breeding and solar ponds designed to store thermal energy ponds and lakes are distinguished from streams via current speed while currents in streams are easily observed ponds and lakes possess thermally driven micro-currents and moderate wind driven currents these features distinguish a pond from many other aquatic terrain features such as stream pools and tide pools  nile cairo egypt river a river is a natural watercourse   usually freshwater  flowing towards an ocean a lake a sea or another river in a few cases a river simply flows into the ground or dries up completely before reaching another body of water small rivers may also be called by several other names including stream creek brook rivulet and rill there is no general rule that defines what can be called a river many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location one example is in scotland and north-east england sometimes a river is said to be larger than a creek but this is not always the case due to vagueness in the language  a river is part of the hydrological cycle  water within a river is generally collected from precipitation through surface runoff  groundwater recharge springs  and the release of stored water in natural ice and snowpacks ie from glaciers  hawaii stream a stream is a flowing body of water with a current  confined within a bed and stream banks  in the united states a stream is classified as a watercourse less than feet  metres wide streams are important as conduits in the water cycle  instruments in groundwater recharge  and they serve as corridors for fish and wildlife migration the biological habitat in the immediate vicinity of a stream is called a riparian zone  given the status of the ongoing holocene extinction  streams play an important corridor role in connecting fragmented habitats and thus in conserving biodiversity  the study of streams and waterways in general involves many branches of inter-disciplinary natural science and engineering including hydrology  fluvial geomorphology  aquatic ecology  fish biology  riparian ecology  and others loch lomond  aravalli mountain range rajasthan thar desert human ecosystem ecology ecosystem ecosystems are composed of a variety of biotic and abiotic components that function in an interrelated way  the structure and composition is determined by various environmental factors that are interrelated variations of these factors will initiate dynamic modifications to the ecosystem some of the more important components are soil  atmosphere  radiation from the sun  water and living organisms bosaws biosphere reserve jinotega central to the ecosystem concept is the idea that living organisms interact with every other element in their local environment  eugene odum a founder of ecology stated any unit that includes all of the organisms ie the community in a given area interacting with the physical environment so that a flow of energy leads to clearly defined trophic structure biotic diversity and material cycles ie exchange of materials between living and nonliving parts within the system is an ecosystem  within the ecosystem species are connected and dependent upon one another in the food chain  and exchange energy and matter between themselves as well as with their environment  the human ecosystem concept is based on the humannature dichotomy and the idea that all species are ecologically dependent on each other as well as with the abiotic constituents of their biotope   a smaller unit of size is called a microecosystem  for example a microsystem can be a stone and all the life under it a might involve a whole ecoregion  with its drainage basin   old growth european beech biogradska gora montenegro wilderness wilderness is generally defined as areas that have not been significantly modified by human activity wilderness areas can be found in preserves estates farms conservation preserves ranches national forests  national parks  and even in urban areas along rivers gulches or otherwise undeveloped areas wilderness areas and protected parks are considered important for the survival of certain species  ecological studies conservation  and solitude some nature writers believe wilderness areas are vital for the human spirit and creativity  and some ecologists consider wilderness areas to be an integral part of the earth self-sustaining natural ecosystem the biosphere  they may also preserve historic genetic traits and that they provide habitat for wild flora and fauna that may be difficult or impossible to recreate in zoos  arboretums  or laboratories  life timeline water single-celled life photosynthesis eukaryotes

universal agreement on the definition of life scientists generally accept that the biological manifestation of life is characterized by organization  metabolism  growth  adaptation  response to stimuli  and reproduction   life may also be said to be simply the characteristic state of organisms  properties common to terrestrial organisms plants animals fungi  protists  archaea  and bacteria are that they are cellular carbon-and-water-based with complex organization having a metabolism a capacity to grow respond to stimuli and reproduce an entity with these properties is generally considered life however not every definition of life considers all of these properties to be essential human-made analogs of life may also be considered to be life the biosphere is the part of earth outer shellincluding land surface rocks water air and the atmospherewithin which life occurs and which biotic processes in turn alter or transform from the broadest geophysiological point of view the biosphere is the global ecological system integrating all living beings and their relationships including their interaction with the elements of the lithosphere rocks hydrosphere water and atmosphere air the entire earth contains over tons  pounds or about  kilograms of biomass life which lives within various environments within the biosphere  over nine-tenths of the total biomass on earth is plant life on which animal life depends very heavily for its existence  more than million species of plant and animal life have been identified to date  and estimates of the actual number of existing species range from several million to well over     the number of individual species of life is constantly in some degree of flux with new species appearing and others ceasing to exist on a continual basis   the total number of species is in rapid decline    amazon rainforest colombia brazil tropical rainforests diversity earth   evolution the origin of life on earth is not well understood but it is known to have occurred at least  years ago    during the hadean or archean eons on a primordial earth that had a substantially different environment than is found at present  these life forms possessed the basic traits of self-replication and inheritable traits once life had appeared the process of evolution by natural selection resulted in the development of ever-more diverse life forms species that were unable to adapt to the changing environment and competition from other life forms became extinct however the fossil record retains evidence of many of these older species current fossil and dna evidence shows that all existing species can trace a continual ancestry back to the first primitive life forms  when basic forms of plant life developed the process of photosynthesis the sun energy could be harvested to create conditions which allowed for more complex life forms  the resultant oxygen accumulated in the atmosphere and gave rise to the ozone layer  the incorporation of smaller cells within larger ones resulted in the development of yet more complex cells called eukaryotes   cells within colonies became increasingly specialized resulting in true multicellular organisms with the ozone layer absorbing harmful ultraviolet radiation  life colonized the surface of earth microbe the first form of life to develop on the earth were microbes and they remained the only form of life until about a billion years ago when multi-cellular organisms began to appear  microorganisms are single-celled organisms that are generally microscopic  and smaller than the human eye can see they include bacteria  fungi  archaea  and protista  these life forms are found in almost every location on the earth where there is liquid water including in the earth interior  their reproduction is both rapid and profuse the combination of a high mutation rate and a horizontal gene transfer  ability makes them highly adaptable and able to survive in new environments including outer space   they form an essential part of the planetary ecosystem however some microorganisms are pathogenic and can post health risk to other organisms plant animal plant species animal species originally aristotle divided all living things between plants which generally do not move fast enough for humans to notice and animals in linnaeus  system these became the kingdoms vegetabilia later plantae  and animalia  since then it has become clear that the plantae as originally defined included several unrelated groups and the fungi and several groups of algae were removed to new kingdoms however these are still often considered plants in many contexts bacterial life is sometimes included in flora   and some classifications use the term separately from  among the many ways of classifying plants are by regional floras  which depending on the purpose of study can also include  remnants of plant life from a previous era people in many regions and countries take great pride in their individual arrays of characteristic flora which can vary widely across the globe due to differences in climate and terrain  regional floras commonly are divided into categories such as and  the lastly mentioned of which are intentionally grown and cultivated some types of native flora actually have been introduced centuries ago by people migrating from one region or continent to another and become an integral part of the native or natural flora of the place to which they were introduced this is an example of how human interaction with nature can blur the boundary of what is considered nature another category of plant has historically been carved out for  though the term has fallen into disfavor among botanists as a formal way to categorize useless plants the informal use of the word weeds to describe those plants that are deemed worthy of elimination is illustrative of the general tendency of people and societies to seek to alter or shape the course of nature similarly animals are often categorized in ways such as     etc according to their relationship to human life animals as a category have several characteristics that generally set them apart from other living things animals are eukaryotic and usually multicellular although see myxozoa  which separates them from bacteria archaea  and most protists  they are heterotrophic  generally digesting food in an internal chamber which separates them from plants and algae  they are also distinguished from plants algae and fungi by lacking cell walls  with a few exceptionsmost notably the two phyla consisting of sponges and placozoans animals have bodies that are differentiated into tissues  these include muscles  which are able to contract and control locomotion and a nervous system  which sends and processes signals there is also typically an internal digestive chamber the eukaryotic cells possessed by all animals are surrounded by a characteristic extracellular matrix composed of collagen and elastic glycoproteins  this may be calcified to form structures like shells  bones  and spicules  a framework upon which cells can move about and be reorganized during development and maturation and which supports the complex anatomy required for mobility hominin timeline hominini nakalipithecus ouranopithecus oreopithecus sahelanthropus orrorin ardipithecus australopithecus homo habilis homo

proportion of the total living biomass on earth the human effect on nature is disproportionately large because of the extent of human influence the boundaries between what humans regard as nature and made environments is not clear cut except at the extremes even at the extremes the amount of natural environment that is free of discernible human influence is diminishing at an increasingly rapid pace a study published in nature found that anthropogenic mass human-made materials outweighs all living biomass on earth with plastic alone exceeding the mass of all land and marine animals combined  and according to a study published in  only about  of the planet terrestrial surface is ecologically and faunally intact with a low human footprint and healthy populations of native animal species   the development of technology by the human race has allowed the greater exploitation of natural resources and has helped to alleviate some of the risk from natural hazards  in spite of this progress however the fate of human civilization remains closely linked to changes in the environment there exists a highly complex feedback loop between the use of advanced technology and changes to the environment that are only slowly becoming understood  man-made threats to the earth natural environment include pollution  deforestation  and disasters such as oil spills humans have contributed to the extinction of many plants and animals  with roughly million species threatened with extinction within decades  the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem functions over the last half century have impacted the extent that nature can contribute to human quality of life  and continued declines could pose a major threat to the continued existence of human civilization unless a rapid course correction is made  the value of natural resources to human society is not reflected in market prices because mostly natural resources are available free of charge this distorts market pricing of natural resources and at the same time leads to underinvestment in our natural assets the annual global cost of public subsidies that damage nature is conservatively estimated at  trillion million million institutional protections of these natural goods such as the oceans and rainforests are lacking governments have not prevented these economic externalities   humans employ nature for both leisure and economic activities the acquisition of natural resources for industrial use remains a sizable component of the world economic system    some activities such as hunting and fishing are used for both sustenance and leisure often by different people agriculture was first adopted around the millennium bce  ranging from food production to energy nature influences economic wealth although early humans gathered uncultivated plant materials for food and employed the medicinal properties of vegetation for healing  most modern human use of plants is through agriculture  the clearance of large tracts of land for crop growth has led to a significant reduction in the amount available of forestation and wetlands  resulting in the loss of habitat for many plant and animal species as well as increased erosion   beauty in nature has historically been a prevalent theme in art and books filling large sections of libraries and bookstores that nature has been depicted and celebrated by so much art photography poetry and other literature shows the strength with which many people associate nature and beauty reasons why this association exists and what the association consists of are studied by the branch of philosophy called aesthetics  beyond certain basic characteristics that many philosophers agree about to explain what is seen as beautiful the opinions are virtually endless  nature and wildness have been important subjects in various eras of world history an early tradition of landscape art began in china during the tang dynasty  the tradition of representing nature became one of the aims of chinese painting and was a significant influence in asian art although natural wonders are celebrated in the psalms and the book of job  wilderness portrayals in art became more prevalent in the  especially in the works of the romantic movement  british artists john constable and j m w turner turned their attention to capturing the beauty of the natural world in their paintings before that paintings had been primarily of religious scenes or of human beings william wordsworth poetry described the wonder of the natural world which had formerly been viewed as a threatening place increasingly the valuing of nature became an aspect of western culture  this artistic movement also coincided with the transcendentalist movement in the western world a common classical idea of beautiful art involves the word mimesis  the imitation of nature also in the realm of ideas about beauty in nature is that the perfect is implied through perfect mathematical forms and more generally by patterns in nature  as david rothenburg writes the beautiful is the root of science and the goal of art the highest possibility that humanity can ever hope to see  hydrogen atom electron orbitals matter energy some fields of science see nature as matter in motion obeying certain laws of nature which science seeks to understand for this reason the most fundamental science is generally understood to be  physics the name for which is still recognizable as meaning that it is the   matter is commonly defined as the substance of which physical objects are composed it constitutes the observable universe  the visible components of the universe are now believed to compose only  percent of the total mass the remainder is believed to consist of  percent cold dark matter and  percent dark energy   the exact arrangement of these components is still unknown and is under intensive investigation by physicists the behaviour of matter and energy throughout the observable universe appears to follow well-defined physical laws  these laws have been employed to produce cosmological models that successfully explain the structure and the evolution of the universe we can observe the mathematical expressions of the laws of physics employ a set of twenty physical constants  that appear to be static across the observable universe  the values of these constants have been carefully measured but the reason for their specific values remains a mystery outer space universe extraterrestrial life planets solar system ngc coma berenices light-years earth outer space also simply called  refers to the relatively empty regions of the universe outside the atmospheres of celestial bodies space is used to distinguish it from airspace and terrestrial locations there is no discrete boundary between earth atmosphere and space as the atmosphere gradually attenuates with increasing altitude outer space within the solar system is called interplanetary space  which passes over into interstellar space at what is known as the heliopause  outer space is sparsely filled with several dozen types of organic molecules discovered to date by microwave spectroscopy  blackbody radiation left over from the big bang and the origin of the universe and cosmic rays  which include ionized atomic nuclei and various subatomic particles  there is also some gas plasma and dust  and small meteors  additionally there are signs of human life in outer space today such as material left over from previous manned and unmanned launches which are a potential hazard to spacecraft some of this debris re-enters the atmosphere periodically although earth is the only body within the solar system known to support life evidence suggests that in the distant past the planet mars possessed bodies of liquid water on the surface  for a brief period in mars history it may have also been capable of forming life at present though most of the water remaining on mars is frozen
if life exists at all on mars it is most likely to be located underground where liquid water can still exist  conditions on the other terrestrial planets mercury and venus  appear to be too harsh to support life as we know it but it has been conjectured that europa  the fourth-largest moon of jupiter  may possess a sub-surface ocean of liquid water and could potentially host life  astronomers have started to discover extrasolar earth analogs planets that lie in the habitable zone of space surrounding a star  and therefore could possibly host life as we know it  force of nature human nature

meaning the science that studies the laws of the stars is a natural science that studies celestial objects and phenomena  it uses mathematics  physics  and chemistry in order to explain their origin and evolution  objects of interest include planets  moons  stars  nebulae  galaxies  and comets  relevant phenomena include supernova explosions gamma ray bursts  quasars  blazars  pulsars  and cosmic microwave background radiation  more generally astronomy studies everything that originates outside earth atmosphere  cosmology is a branch of astronomy that studies the universe as a whole  astronomy is one of the oldest natural sciences the early civilizations in recorded history made methodical observations of the night sky  these include the babylonians  greeks  indians  egyptians  chinese  maya  and many ancient indigenous peoples of the americas  in the past astronomy included disciplines as diverse as astrometry  celestial   observational astronomy  and the making of calendars  nowadays professional astronomy is often said to be the same as astrophysics   professional astronomy is split into observational and theoretical branches observational astronomy is focused on acquiring data from observations of astronomical objects this data is then analyzed using basic principles of physics theoretical astronomy is oriented toward the development of computer or analytical models to describe astronomical objects and phenomena these two fields complement each other theoretical astronomy seeks to explain observational results and observations are used to confirm theoretical results astronomy is one of the few sciences in which amateurs play an active role  this is especially true for the discovery and observation of transient events  amateur astronomers have helped with many important discoveries such as finding new comets contents quito astronomical observatory equator quito ecuador  from the greek from  star and - -nomia from  law or culture means law of the stars or culture of the stars depending on the translation astronomy should not be confused with astrology  the belief system which claims that human affairs are correlated with the positions of celestial objects  although the two fields share a common origin they are now entirely distinct  astronomy and astrophysics are synonyms    based on strict dictionary definitions astronomy refers to the study of objects and matter outside the earth atmosphere and of their physical and chemical properties  while astrophysics refers to the branch of astronomy dealing with the behavior physical properties and dynamic processes of celestial objects and phenomena  in some cases as in the introduction of the introductory textbook by frank shu  astronomy may be used to describe the qualitative study of the subject whereas astrophysics is used to describe the physics-oriented version of the subject  however since most modern astronomical re deals with subjects related to physics modern astronomy could actually be called astrophysics  some fields such as astrometry are purely astronomy rather than also astrophysics various departments in which scientists carry out re on this subject may use astronomy and astrophysics partly depending on whether the department is historically affiliated with a physics department  and many professional astronomers have physics rather than astronomy degrees  some titles of the leading scientific journals in this field include the astronomical journal  the astrophysical journal  and astronomy  astrophysics  frederik de wit history of astronomy archaeoastronomy list of astronomers in early historic times astronomy only consisted of the observation and predictions of the motions of objects visible to the naked eye in some locations early cultures assembled massive artifacts that possibly had some astronomical purpose in addition to their ceremonial uses these observatories could be employed to determine the seasons an important factor in knowing when to plant crops and in understanding the length of the year  before tools such as the telescope were invented early study of the stars was conducted using the naked eye as civilizations developed most notably in mesopotamia  greece  persia  india  china  egypt  and central america  astronomical observatories were assembled and ideas on the nature of the universe began to develop most early astronomy consisted of mapping the positions of the stars and planets a science now referred to as astrometry  from these observations early ideas about the motions of the planets were formed and the nature of the sun moon and the earth in the universe were explored philosophically the earth was believed to be the center of the universe with the sun the moon and the stars rotating around it this is known as the geocentric model of the universe or the ptolemaic system  named after ptolemy   jains  a particularly important early development was the beginning of mathematical and scientific astronomy which began among the babylonians  who laid the foundations for the later astronomical traditions that developed in many other civilizations  the babylonians discovered that lunar eclipses recurred in a repeating cycle known as a saros   sundial alexandria on the oxus following the babylonians significant advances in astronomy were made in ancient greece and the hellenistic world greek astronomy is characterized from the start by seeking a rational physical explanation for celestial phenomena  in the century bc aristarchus of samos estimated the size and distance of the moon and sun  and he proposed a model of the solar system where the earth and planets rotated around the sun now called the heliocentric model  in the century bc hipparchus discovered precession  calculated the size and distance of the moon and invented the earliest known astronomical devices such as the astrolabe   hipparchus also created a comprehensive catalog of stars and most of the constellations of the northern hemisphere derive from greek astronomy  the antikythera mechanism c bc was an early analog computer designed to calculate the location of the sun  moon  and planets for a given date technological artifacts of similar complexity did not reappear until the century when mechanical astronomical clocks appeared in europe  medieval europe housed a number of important astronomers richard of wallingford  made major contributions to astronomy and horology  including the invention of the first astronomical clock the rectangulus which allowed for the measurement of angles between planets and other astronomical bodies as well as an equatorium called the which could be used for astronomical calculations such as lunar  solar and planetary longitudes and could predict eclipses  nicole oresme  and jean buridan  first discussed evidence for the rotation of the earth furthermore buridan also developed the theory of impetus predecessor of the modern scientific theory of inertia  which was able to show planets were capable of motion without the intervention of angels  georg von peuerbach  and regiomontanus  helped make astronomical progress instrumental to copernicus development of the heliocentric model decades later astronomy flourished in the islamic world and other parts of the world this led to the emergence of the first astronomical observatories in the muslim world by the early century    in  the andromeda galaxy  the largest galaxy in the local group  was described by the persian muslim astronomer abd al-rahman al-sufi in his book of fixed stars   the sn supernova  the brightest apparent magnitude stellar event in recorded history was observed by the egyptian arabic astronomer ali ibn ridwan and chinese astronomers in  some of the prominent islamic mostly persian and arab astronomers who made significant contributions to the science include al-battani  thebit  abd al-rahman al-sufi  biruni  ab ishq ibrhm al-zarql  al-birjandi  and the astronomers of the maragheh and samarkand observatories astronomers during that time introduced many arabic names now used for individual stars    it is also believed that the ruins at great zimbabwe and timbuktu  may have housed astronomical observatories  in post-classical west africa  astronomers studied the movement of stars and relation to seasons crafting charts of the heavens as well as precise diagrams of orbits of the other planets based on complex mathematical calculations songhai historian mahmud kati documented a meteor shower in august    europeans had previously believed that there had been no astronomical observation in sub-saharan africa during the pre-colonial middle ages but modern discoveries show otherwise     for over six centuries from the recovery of ancient learning during the late middle ages into the enlightenment the roman catholic church gave more financial and social support to the study of astronomy than probably all other institutions among the church motives was finding the date for easter  galileo moon during the renaissance  nicolaus copernicus proposed a heliocentric model of the solar system his work was defended by galileo galilei and expanded upon by johannes kepler  kepler was the first to devise a system that correctly described the details of the motion of the planets around the sun however kepler did not succeed in formulating a theory behind the laws he wrote down  it was isaac newton  with his invention of celestial dynamics and his law of gravitation  who finally explained the motions of the planets newton also developed the reflecting telescope   improvements in the size and quality of the telescope led to further discoveries the english astronomer john flamsteed catalogued over stars  more extensive star catalogues were produced by nicolas louis de lacaille  the astronomer william herschel made a detailed catalog of nebulosity and clusters and in discovered the planet uranus  the first new planet found  during the centuries the study of the three-body problem by leonhard euler  alexis claude clairaut  and jean le rond d led to more accurate predictions about the motions of the moon and planets this work was further refined by joseph-louis lagrange and pierre simon laplace  allowing the masses of the planets and moons to be estimated from their perturbations  significant advances in astronomy came about with the introduction of new technology including the spectroscope and photography  joseph von fraunhofer discovered about bands in the spectrum of the sun in  which in  gustav kirchhoff ascribed to the presence of different elements stars were proven to be similar to the earth own sun but with a wide range of temperatures  masses  and sizes  the existence of the earth galaxy the milky way  as its own group of stars was only proved in the century along with the existence of external galaxies the observed recession of those galaxies led to the discovery of the expansion of the universe   theoretical astronomy led to speculations on the existence of objects such as black holes and neutron stars  which have been used to explain such observed phenomena as quasars  pulsars  blazars  and radio galaxies  physical cosmology made huge advances during the century in the early the model of the big bang theory was formulated heavily evidenced by cosmic microwave background radiation  hubble law  and the cosmological abundances of elements  space telescopes have enabled measurements in parts of the electromagnetic spectrum normally blocked or blurred by the atmosphere in february  it was revealed that the ligo project had detected evidence of gravitational waves in the previous september   observational astronomy the main source of information about celestial bodies and other objects is visible light  or more generally electromagnetic radiation   observational astronomy may be categorized according to the corresponding region of the electromagnetic spectrum on which the observations are made some parts of the spectrum can be observed from the earth surface while other parts are only observable from either high altitudes or outside the earth atmosphere specific information on these subfields is given below very large array new mexico radio telescope radio astronomy radio astronomy uses radiation with wavelengths greater than approximately one millimeter outside the visible range  radio astronomy is different from most other forms of observational astronomy in that the observed radio waves can be treated as waves rather than as discrete photons  hence it is relatively easier to measure both the amplitude and phase of radio waves whereas this is not as easily done at shorter wavelengths  although some radio waves are emitted directly by astronomical objects a product of thermal emission  most of the radio emission that is observed is the result of synchrotron radiation  which is produced when electrons orbit magnetic fields   additionally a number of spectral lines produced by interstellar gas  notably the hydrogen spectral line at  are observable at radio wavelengths   a wide variety of other objects are observable at radio wavelengths including supernovae  interstellar gas pulsars  and active galactic nuclei    alma  infrared astronomy infrared astronomy is founded on the detection and analysis of infrared radiation wavelengths longer than red light and outside the range of our vision the infrared spectrum is useful for studying objects that are too cold to radiate visible light such as planets circumstellar disks or nebulae whose light is blocked by dust the longer wavelengths of infrared can penetrate clouds of dust that block visible light allowing the observation of young stars embedded in molecular clouds and the cores of galaxies observations from the wide-field infrared survey explorer wise have been particularly effective at unveiling numerous galactic protostars and their host star clusters    with the exception of infrared wavelengths close to visible light such radiation is heavily absorbed by the atmosphere or masked as the atmosphere itself produces significant infrared emission consequently infrared observatories have to be located in high dry places on earth or in space  some molecules radiate strongly in the infrared this allows the study of the chemistry of space more specifically it can detect water in comets  subaru telescope keck observatory mauna kea nasa infrared telescope facility optical astronomy historically optical astronomy also called visible light astronomy is the oldest form of astronomy  images of observations were originally drawn by hand in the late century and most of the century images were made using photographic equipment modern images are made using digital detectors particularly using charge-coupled devices ccds and recorded on modern medium although visible light itself extends from approximately to  nm to   that same equipment can be used to observe some near-ultraviolet and near-infrared radiation ultraviolet astronomy ultraviolet astronomy employs ultraviolet wavelengths between approximately and  to   light at those wavelengths is absorbed by the earth atmosphere requiring observations at these wavelengths to be performed from the upper atmosphere or from space ultraviolet astronomy is best suited to the study of thermal radiation and spectral emission lines from hot blue stars  ob stars  that are very bright in this wave band this includes the blue stars in other galaxies which have been the targets of several ultraviolet surveys other objects commonly observed in ultraviolet light include planetary nebulae  supernova remnants  and active galactic nuclei  however as ultraviolet light is easily absorbed by interstellar dust  an adjustment of ultraviolet measurements is necessary  x-ray astronomy x-ray astronomy uses x-ray wavelengths  typically x-ray radiation is produced by synchrotron emission the result of electrons orbiting magnetic field lines thermal emission from thin gases above  kelvins  and thermal emission from thick gases above kelvin  since x-rays are absorbed by the earth atmosphere  all x-ray observations must be performed from high-altitude balloons  rockets  or x-ray astronomy satellites  notable x-ray sources include x-ray binaries  pulsars  supernova remnants  elliptical galaxies  clusters of galaxies  and active galactic nuclei   gamma ray astronomy gamma ray astronomy observes astronomical objects at the shortest wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum gamma rays may be observed directly by satellites such as the compton gamma ray observatory or by specialized telescopes called atmospheric cherenkov telescopes   the cherenkov telescopes do not detect the gamma rays directly but instead detect the flashes of visible light produced when gamma rays are absorbed by the earth atmosphere  most gamma-ray emitting sources are actually gamma-ray bursts  objects which only produce gamma radiation for a few milliseconds to thousands of seconds before fading away only  of gamma-ray sources are non-transient sources these steady gamma-ray emitters include pulsars neutron stars  and black hole candidates such as active galactic nuclei  in addition to electromagnetic radiation a few other events originating from great distances may be observed from the earth in neutrino astronomy  astronomers use heavily shielded underground facilities such as sage  gallex  and kamioka iiiii for the detection of neutrinos  the vast majority of the neutrinos streaming through the earth originate from the sun  but neutrinos were also detected from supernova   cosmic rays  which consist of very high energy particles atomic nuclei that can decay or be absorbed when they enter the earth atmosphere result in a cascade of secondary particles which can be detected by current observatories  some future neutrino detectors may also be sensitive to the particles produced when cosmic rays hit the earth atmosphere  gravitational-wave astronomy is an emerging field of astronomy that employs gravitational-wave detectors to collect observational data about distant massive objects a few observatories have been constructed such as the ligo  ligo made its first detection on september  observing gravitational waves from a binary black hole   a second gravitational wave was detected on december and additional observations should continue but gravitational waves require extremely sensitive instruments   the combination of observations made using electromagnetic radiation neutrinos or gravitational waves and other complementary information is known as multi-messenger astronomy    astrometry celestial mechanics pismis one of the oldest fields in astronomy and in all of science is the measurement of the positions of celestial objects historically accurate knowledge of the positions of the sun moon planets and stars has been essential in celestial  the use of celestial objects to guide  and in the making of calendars  careful measurement of the positions of the planets has led to a solid understanding of gravitational perturbations  and an ability to determine past and future positions of the planets with great accuracy a field known as celestial mechanics  more recently the tracking of near-earth objects will allow for predictions of close encounters or potential collisions of the earth with those objects  the measurement of stellar parallax of nearby stars provides a fundamental baseline in the cosmic distance ladder that is used to measure the scale of the universe parallax measurements of nearby stars provide an absolute baseline for the properties of more distant stars as their properties can be compared measurements of the radial velocity and proper motion of stars allow astronomers to plot the movement of these systems through the milky way galaxy astrometric results are the basis used to calculate the distribution of speculated dark matter in the galaxy  during the  the measurement of the stellar wobble of nearby stars was used to detect large extrasolar planets orbiting those stars  nucleosynthesis stellar nucleosynthesis big bang nucleosynthesis supernova nucleosynthesis cosmic ray spallation astrophysics nuclear fusion r-process s-process nuclear fission theoretical astronomy theoretical astronomers use several tools including analytical models and computational numerical simulations  each has its particular advantages analytical models of a process are better for giving broader insight into the heart of what is going on numerical models reveal the existence of phenomena and effects otherwise unobserved   theorists in astronomy endeavor to create theoretical models and from the results predict observational consequences of those models the observation of a phenomenon predicted by a model allows astronomers to select between several alternate or conflicting models as the one best able to describe the phenomena theorists also try to generate or modify models to take into account new data in the case of an inconsistency between the data and the model results the general tendency is to try to make minimal modifications to the model so that it produces results that fit the data in some cases a large amount of inconsistent data over time may lead to the total abandonment of a model phenomena modeled by theoretical astronomers include stellar dynamics and evolution  galaxy formation  large-scale distribution of matter in the universe  origin of cosmic rays  general relativity and physical cosmology  including string cosmology and astroparticle physics  astrophysical relativity serves as a tool to gauge the properties of large scale structures for which gravitation plays a significant role in physical phenomena investigated and as the basis for black hole   physics and the study of gravitational waves  some widely accepted and studied theories and models in astronomy now included in the lambda-cdm model are the big bang  dark matter and fundamental theories of physics

astronomy general relativity black holes andromeda galaxy cno cycle along with cosmic inflation  dark matter and dark energy are the current leading topics in astronomy  as their discovery and controversy originated during the study of the galaxies physics chemistry hubble telescopes astrophysics is the branch of astronomy that employs the principles of physics and chemistry to ascertain the nature of the astronomical objects  rather than their positions or motions in space   among the objects studied are the sun  other stars  galaxies  extrasolar planets  the interstellar medium and the cosmic microwave background    their emissions are examined across all parts of the electromagnetic spectrum  and the properties examined include luminosity  density  temperature  and chemical composition because astrophysics is a very broad subject typically apply many disciplines of physics including mechanics  electromagnetism  statistical mechanics  thermodynamics  quantum mechanics  relativity  nuclear and particle physics  and atomic and molecular physics  in practice modern astronomical re often involves a substantial amount of work in the realms of theoretical and observational physics some areas of study for astrophysicists include their attempts to determine the properties of dark matter  dark energy  and black holes  whether or not time travel is possible wormholes can form or the multiverse exists and the origin and ultimate fate of the universe   topics also studied by theoretical astrophysicists include solar system formation and evolution  stellar dynamics and evolution  galaxy formation and evolution  magnetohydrodynamics  large-scale structure of matter in the universe origin of cosmic rays  general relativity and physical cosmology  including string cosmology and astroparticle physics  astrochemistry is the study of the abundance and reactions of molecules in the universe  and their interaction with radiation   the discipline is an overlap of astronomy and chemistry  the word astrochemistry may be applied to both the solar system and the interstellar medium  the study of the abundance of elements and isotope ratios in solar system objects such as meteorites  is also called cosmochemistry  while the study of interstellar atoms and molecules and their interaction with radiation is sometimes called molecular astrophysics the formation atomic and chemical composition evolution and fate of molecular gas clouds is of special interest because it is from these clouds that solar systems form studies in this field contribute to the understanding of the formation of the solar system  earth origin and geology abiogenesis  and the origin of climate and oceans astrobiology is an interdisciplinary scientific field concerned with the origins  early evolution  distribution and future of life in the universe  astrobiology considers the question of whether extraterrestrial life exists and how humans can detect it if it does  the term exobiology is similar  astrobiology makes use of molecular biology  biophysics  biochemistry  chemistry  astronomy physical cosmology  exoplanetology and geology to investigate the possibility of life on other worlds and help recognize biospheres that might be different from that on earth  the origin and early evolution of life is an inseparable part of the discipline of astrobiology  astrobiology concerns itself with interpretation of existing scientific data  and although speculation is entertained to give context astrobiology concerns itself primarily with hypotheses that fit firmly into existing scientific theories  this interdisciplinary field encompasses re on the origin of planetary systems  origins of organic compounds in space  rock-water-carbon interactions abiogenesis on earth planetary habitability  re on biosignatures for life detection and studies on the potential for life to adapt to challenges on earth and in outer space     nature

a whole hubble extreme deep field observations of the large-scale structure of the universe  a branch known as physical cosmology  have provided a deep understanding of the formation and evolution of the cosmos fundamental to modern cosmology is the well-accepted theory of the big bang  wherein our universe began at a single point in time and thereafter expanded over the course of  billion years  to its present condition  the concept of the big bang can be traced back to the discovery of the microwave background radiation in   in the course of this expansion the universe underwent several evolutionary stages in the very early moments it is theorized that the universe experienced a very rapid cosmic inflation  which homogenized the starting conditions thereafter nucleosynthesis produced the elemental abundance of the early universe  see also nucleocosmochronology  when the first neutral atoms formed from a sea of primordial ions space became transparent to radiation releasing the energy viewed today as the microwave background radiation the expanding universe then underwent a dark age due to the lack of stellar energy sources  a hierarchical structure of matter began to form from minute variations in the mass density of space matter accumulated in the densest regions forming clouds of gas and the earliest stars the population iii stars  these massive stars triggered the reionization process and are believed to have created many of the heavy elements in the early universe which through nuclear decay create lighter elements allowing the cycle of nucleosynthesis to continue longer  gravitational aggregations clustered into filaments leaving voids in the gaps gradually organizations of gas and dust merged to form the first primitive galaxies over time these pulled in more matter and were often organized into groups and clusters of galaxies then into larger-scale superclusters  various fields of physics are crucial to studying the universe interdisciplinary studies involve the fields of quantum mechanics  particle physics  plasma physics  condensed matter physics  statistical mechanics  optics  and nuclear physics  fundamental to the structure of the universe is the existence of dark matter and dark energy  these are now thought to be its dominant components forming  of the mass of the universe for this reason much effort is expended in trying to understand the physics of these components  gravitational lens extragalactic astronomy the study of objects outside our galaxy is a branch of astronomy concerned with the formation and evolution of galaxies  their morphology description and classification  the observation of active galaxies  and at a larger scale the groups and clusters of galaxies  finally the latter is important for the understanding of the large-scale structure of the cosmos  most galaxies are organized into distinct shapes that allow for classification schemes they are commonly divided into spiral  elliptical and irregular galaxies  as the name suggests an elliptical galaxy has the cross-sectional shape of an ellipse  the stars move along random orbits with no preferred direction these galaxies contain little or no interstellar dust few star-forming regions and older stars elliptical galaxies are more commonly found at the core of galactic clusters and may have been formed through mergers of large galaxies a spiral galaxy is organized into a flat rotating disk usually with a prominent bulge or bar at the center and trailing bright arms that spiral outward the arms are dusty regions of star formation within which massive young stars produce a blue tint spiral galaxies are typically surrounded by a halo of older stars both the milky way and one of our nearest galaxy neighbors the andromeda galaxy  are spiral galaxies irregular galaxies are chaotic in appearance and are neither spiral nor elliptical about a quarter of all galaxies are irregular and the peculiar shapes of such galaxies may be the result of gravitational interaction an active galaxy is a formation that emits a significant amount of its energy from a source other than its stars dust and gas it is powered by a compact region at the core thought to be a supermassive black hole that is emitting radiation from in-falling material a radio galaxy is an active galaxy that is very luminous in the radio portion of the spectrum and is emitting immense plumes or lobes of gas active galaxies that emit shorter frequency high-energy radiation include seyfert galaxies  quasars  and blazars  quasars are believed to be the most consistently luminous objects in the known universe  the large-scale structure of the cosmos is represented by groups and clusters of galaxies this structure is organized into a hierarchy of groupings with the largest being the superclusters  the collective matter is formed into filaments and walls leaving large voids between  milky way galactic astronomy the solar system orbits within the milky way  a barred spiral galaxy that is a prominent member of the local group of galaxies it is a rotating mass of gas dust stars and other objects held together by mutual gravitational attraction as the earth is located within the dusty outer arms there are large portions of the milky way that are obscured from view in the center of the milky way is the core a bar-shaped bulge with what is believed to be a supermassive black hole at its center this is surrounded by four primary arms that spiral from the core this is a region of active star formation that contains many younger population i stars the disk is surrounded by a spheroid halo of older population ii stars as well as relatively dense concentrations of stars known as globular clusters   between the stars lies the interstellar medium  a region of sparse matter in the densest regions molecular clouds of molecular hydrogen and other elements create star-forming regions these begin as a compact pre-stellar core or dark nebulae  which concentrate and collapse in volumes determined by the jeans length  to form compact protostars  as the more massive stars appear they transform the cloud into an h ii region ionized atomic hydrogen of glowing gas and plasma the stellar wind and supernova explosions from these stars eventually cause the cloud to disperse often leaving behind one or more young open clusters of stars these clusters gradually disperse and the stars join the population of the milky way  kinematic studies of matter in the milky way and other galaxies have demonstrated that there is more mass than can be accounted for by visible matter a dark matter halo appears to dominate the mass although the nature of this dark matter remains undetermined  mz star the study of stars and stellar evolution is fundamental to our understanding of the universe the astrophysics of stars has been determined through observation and theoretical understanding and from computer simulations of the interior  star formation occurs in dense regions of dust and gas known as giant molecular clouds  when destabilized cloud fragments can collapse under the influence of gravity to form a protostar  a sufficiently dense and hot core region will trigger nuclear fusion  thus creating a main-sequence star   almost all elements heavier than hydrogen and helium were created inside the cores of stars  the characteristics of the resulting star depend primarily upon its starting mass the more massive the star the greater its luminosity and the more rapidly it fuses its hydrogen fuel into helium in its core over time this hydrogen fuel is completely converted into helium and the star begins to evolve  the fusion of helium requires a higher core temperature a star with a high enough core temperature will push its outer layers outward while increasing its core density the resulting red giant formed by the expanding outer layers enjoys a brief life span before the helium fuel in the core is in turn consumed very massive stars can also undergo a series of evolutionary phases as they fuse increasingly heavier elements  the final fate of the star depends on its mass with stars of mass greater than about eight times the sun becoming core collapse supernovae   while smaller stars blow off their outer layers and leave behind the inert core in the form of a white dwarf  the ejection of the outer layers forms a planetary nebula   the remnant of a supernova is a dense neutron star  or if the stellar mass was at least three times that of the sun a black hole   closely orbiting binary stars can follow more complex evolutionary paths such as mass transfer onto a white dwarf companion that can potentially cause a supernova  planetary nebulae and supernovae distribute the  metals  produced in the star by fusion to the interstellar medium without them all new stars and their planetary systems would be formed from hydrogen and helium alone  solar astronomy ultraviolet photosphere trace nasa lomnick tt slovakia sun solar telescope at a distance of about eight light-minutes the most frequently studied star is the sun  a typical main-sequence dwarf star of stellar class v and about  billion years gyr old the sun is not considered a variable star  but it does undergo periodic changes in activity known as the sunspot cycle  this is an -year oscillation in sunspot number  sunspots are regions of lower-than- average temperatures that are associated with intense magnetic activity  the sun has steadily increased in luminosity by  since it first became a main-sequence star the sun has also undergone periodic changes in luminosity that can have a significant impact on the earth  the maunder minimum  for example is believed to have caused the little ice age phenomenon during the middle ages   the visible outer surface of the sun is called the photosphere  above this layer is a thin region known as the chromosphere  this is surrounded by a transition region of rapidly increasing temperatures and finally by the super-heated corona  at the center of the sun is the core region a volume of sufficient temperature and pressure for nuclear fusion to occur above the core is the radiation zone  where the plasma conveys the energy flux by means of radiation above that is the convection zone where the gas material transports energy primarily through physical displacement of the gas known as convection it is believed that the movement of mass within the convection zone creates the magnetic activity that generates sunspots  a solar wind of plasma particles constantly streams outward from the sun until at the outermost limit of the solar system it reaches the heliopause  as the solar wind passes the earth it interacts with the earth magnetic field  magnetosphere  and deflects the solar wind but traps some creating the van allen radiation belts that envelop the earth the aurora are created when solar wind particles are guided by the magnetic flux lines into the earth polar regions where the lines then descend into the atmosphere   dust devil mars martian atmosphere tornado planetary science planetary geology planetary science is the study of the assemblage of planets  moons  dwarf planets  comets  asteroids  and other bodies orbiting the sun as well as extrasolar planets the solar system has been relatively well-studied initially through telescopes and then later by spacecraft this has provided a good overall understanding of the formation and evolution of the sun planetary system although many new discoveries are still being made  the solar system is divided into the inner solar system subdivided into the inner planets and the asteroid belt  the outer solar system subdivided into the outer planets and centaurs  comets the trans-neptunian region subdivided into the kuiper belt  and the scattered disc  and the farthest regions eg boundaries of the heliosphere  and the oort cloud  which may extend as far as a light-year the inner terrestrial planets consist of mercury  venus  earth and mars  the outer giant planets are the gas giants  jupiter and saturn  and the ice giants  uranus and neptune   the planets were formed  billion years ago in the protoplanetary disk that surrounded the early sun through a process that included gravitational attraction collision and accretion the disk formed clumps of matter that with time became protoplanets the radiation pressure of the solar wind then expelled most of the unaccreted matter and only those planets with sufficient mass retained their gaseous atmosphere the planets continued to sweep up or eject the remaining matter during a period of intense bombardment evidenced by the many impact craters on the moon during this period some of the protoplanets may have collided and one such collision may have formed the moon   once a planet reaches sufficient mass the materials of different densities segregate within during planetary differentiation  this process can form a stony or metallic core surrounded by a mantle and an outer crust the core may include solid and liquid regions and some planetary cores generate their own magnetic field  which can protect their atmospheres from solar wind stripping  a planet or moon interior heat is produced from the collisions that created the body by the decay of radioactive materials  uranium  thorium  and al  or tidal heating caused by interactions with other bodies some planets and moons accumulate enough heat to drive geologic processes such as volcanism and tectonics those that accumulate or retain an atmosphere can also undergo surface erosion from wind or water smaller bodies without tidal heating cool more quickly and their geological activity ceases with the exception of impact cratering  astronomy and astrophysics have developed significant interdisciplinary links with other major scientific fields archaeoastronomy is the study of ancient or traditional astronomies in their cultural context utilizing archaeological and anthropological evidence astrobiology is the study of the advent and evolution of biological systems in the universe with particular emphasis on the possibility of non-terrestrial life astrostatistics is the application of statistics to astrophysics to the analysis of a vast amount of observational astrophysical data the study of chemicals found in space including their formation interaction and destruction is called astrochemistry  these substances are usually found in molecular clouds  although they may also appear in low-temperature stars brown dwarfs and planets cosmochemistry is the study of the chemicals found within the solar system including the origins of the elements and variations in the isotope ratios both of these fields represent an overlap of the disciplines of astronomy and chemistry as  forensic astronomy  finally methods from astronomy have been used to solve problems of law and history stellafane amateur astronomy astronomy is one of the sciences to which amateurs can contribute the most  collectively amateur astronomers observe a variety of celestial objects and phenomena sometimes with equipment that they build themselves  common targets of amateur astronomers include the sun the moon planets stars comets meteor showers  and a variety of deep-sky objects such as star clusters galaxies and nebulae astronomy clubs are located throughout the world and many have programs to help their members set up and complete observational programs including those to observe all the objects in the messier  objects or herschel catalogues of points of interest in the night sky one branch of amateur astronomy amateur astrophotography  involves the taking of photos of the night sky many amateurs like to specialize in the observation of particular objects types of objects or types of events that interest them   most amateurs work at visible wavelengths but a small minority experiment with wavelengths outside the visible spectrum this includes the use of infrared filters on conventional telescopes and also the use of radio telescopes the pioneer of amateur radio astronomy was karl jansky  who started observing the sky at radio wavelengths in the  a number of amateur astronomers use either homemade telescopes or use radio telescopes which were originally built for astronomy re but which are now available to amateurs  the one-mile telescope    amateur astronomers continue to make scientific contributions to the field of astronomy and it is one of the few scientific disciplines where amateurs can still make significant contributions amateurs can make occultation measurements that are used to refine the orbits of minor planets they can also discover comets and perform regular observations of variable stars improvements in digital technology have allowed amateurs to make impressive advances in the field of astrophotography    list of unsolved problems in

has been expanding ever since while the spatial size of the entire universe is unknown  the cosmic inflation equation indicates that it must have a minimum diameter of trillion light years  and it is possible to measure the size of the observable universe  which is approximately billion light-years in diameter at the present day the earliest cosmological models of the universe were developed by ancient greek and indian philosophers and were geocentric  placing earth at the center   over the centuries more precise astronomical observations led nicolaus copernicus to develop the heliocentric model with the sun at the center of the solar system  in developing the law of universal gravitation  isaac newton built upon copernicus work as well as johannes kepler laws of planetary motion and observations by tycho brahe  further observational improvements led to the realization that the sun is one of hundreds of billions of stars in the milky way  which is one of a few hundred billion galaxies in the universe many of the stars in galaxy have planets  at the largest scale  galaxies are distributed uniformly and the same in all directions meaning that the universe has neither an edge nor a center at smaller scales galaxies are distributed in clusters and superclusters which form immense filaments and voids in space creating a vast foam-like structure  discoveries in the early century have suggested that the universe had a beginning and that space has been expanding since then  at an increasing rate  according to the big bang theory the energy and matter initially present have become less dense as the universe expanded after an initial accelerated expansion called the inflationary epoch at around seconds and the separation of the four known fundamental forces  the universe gradually cooled and continued to expand allowing the first subatomic particles and simple atoms to form dark matter gradually gathered forming a foam -like structure of filaments and voids under the influence of gravity  giant clouds of hydrogen and helium were gradually drawn to the places where dark matter was most dense  forming the first galaxies stars and everything else seen today from studying the movement of galaxies it has been discovered that the universe contains much more matter than is accounted for by visible objects stars galaxies nebulas and interstellar gas this unseen matter is known as dark matter   means that there is a wide range of strong indirect evidence that it exists but we have not yet detected it directly the cdm model is the most widely accepted model of the universe it suggests that about  of the mass and energy in the universe is a cosmological constant or in extensions to cdm other forms of dark energy  such as a scalar field  which is responsible for the current expansion of space  and about  is dark matter  ordinary  baryonic  matter is therefore only  of the physical universe  stars planets and visible gas clouds only form about  of the ordinary matter  there are many competing hypotheses about the ultimate fate of the universe and about what if anything preceded the big bang while other physicists and philosophers refuse to speculate doubting that information about prior states will ever be accessible some physicists have suggested various multiverse hypotheses in which our universe might be one among many universes that

comprise all of energy in its various forms including electromagnetic radiation and matter  and therefore planets moons  stars galaxies and the contents of intergalactic space     the universe also includes the physical laws that influence energy and matter such as conservation laws  classical mechanics  and relativity   the universe is often defined as the totality of existence or everything that exists everything that has existed and everything that will exist  in fact some philosophers and scientists support the inclusion of ideas and abstract conceptssuch as mathematics and logicin the definition of the universe    the word may also refer to concepts such as   and    the word derives from the old french word  which in turn derives from the latin word   the latin word was used by cicero and later latin authors in many of the same senses as the modern english word is used  a term for universe among the ancient greek philosophers from pythagoras onwards was  the all defined as all matter and all space and  all things which did not necessarily include the void   another synonym was  meaning the world  the cosmos   synonyms are also found in latin authors      and survive in

earliest multicellular life earliest fungi sexual reproduction earliest animals plants cambrian explosion earliest mammals earliest apes humans l i f e billion years ago the prevailing model for the evolution of the universe is the big bang theory   the big bang model states that the earliest state of the universe was an extremely hot and dense one and that the universe subsequently expanded and cooled the model is based on general relativity and on simplifying assumptions such as homogeneity and isotropy of space a version of the model with a cosmological constant lambda and cold dark matter  known as the lambda-cdm model  is the simplest model that provides a reasonably good account of various observations about the universe the big bang model accounts for observations such as the correlation of distance and redshift of galaxies the ratio of the number of hydrogen to helium atoms and the microwave radiation background the initial hot dense state is called the planck epoch  a brief period extending from time zero to one planck time unit of approximately seconds during the planck epoch all types of matter and all types of energy were concentrated into a dense state and gravity currently the weakest by far of the four known forces is believed to have been as strong as the other fundamental forces and all the forces may have been unified  since the planck epoch space has been expanding to its present scale with a very short but intense period of cosmic inflation believed to have occurred within the first seconds  this was a kind of expansion different from those we can see around us today objects in space did not physically move instead the metric that defines space itself changed although objects in spacetime cannot move faster than the speed of light  this limitation does not apply to the metric governing spacetime itself this initial period of inflation is believed to explain why space appears to be very flat and much larger than light could travel since the start of the universe within the first fraction of a second of the universe existence the four fundamental forces had separated as the universe continued to cool down from its inconceivably hot state various types of subatomic particles were able to form in short periods of time known as the quark epoch  the hadron epoch  and the lepton epoch  together these epochs encompassed less than seconds of time following the big bang these elementary particles associated stably into ever larger combinations including stable protons and neutrons  which then formed more complex atomic nuclei through nuclear fusion  this process known as big bang nucleosynthesis  only lasted for about minutes and ended about minutes after the big bang so only the fastest and simplest reactions occurred about  of the protons and all the neutrons in the universe by mass were converted to helium  with small amounts of deuterium a form of hydrogen  and traces of lithium  any other element was only formed in very tiny quantities the other  of the protons remained unaffected as hydrogen nuclei after nucleosynthesis ended the universe entered a period known as the photon epoch  during this period the universe was still far too hot for matter to form neutral atoms  so it contained a hot dense foggy plasma of negatively charged electrons  neutral neutrinos and positive nuclei after about  years the universe had cooled enough that electrons and nuclei could form the first stable atoms  this is known as recombination for historical reasons in fact electrons and nuclei were combining for the first time unlike plasma neutral atoms are transparent to many wavelengths of light so for the first time the universe also became transparent the photons released  decoupled  when these atoms formed can still be seen today they form the cosmic microwave background cmb as the universe expands the energy density of electromagnetic radiation decreases more quickly than does that of matter because the energy of a photon decreases with its wavelength at around  years the energy density of matter became larger than that of photons and neutrinos  and began to dominate the large scale behavior of the universe this marked the end of the radiation-dominated era and the start of the matter-dominated era  in the earliest stages of the universe tiny fluctuations within the universe density led to concentrations of dark matter gradually forming ordinary matter attracted to these by gravity  formed large gas clouds and eventually stars and galaxies where the dark matter was most dense and voids where it was least dense after around - million years the first stars formed known as population iii stars these were probably very massive luminous non metallic and short-lived they were responsible for the gradual reionization of the universe between about - million years and billion years and also for seeding the universe with elements heavier than helium through stellar nucleosynthesis   the universe also contains a mysterious energypossibly a scalar field called dark energy  the density of which does not change over time after about  billion years the universe had expanded sufficiently so that the density of matter was less than the density of dark energy marking the beginning of the present dark-energy-dominated era   in this era the expansion of the universe is accelerating due to dark energy observable universe age of the universe metric expansion of space of the four fundamental interactions  gravitation is the dominant at astronomical length scales gravity effects are cumulative by contrast the effects of positive and negative charges tend to cancel one another making electromagnetism relatively insignificant on astronomical length scales the remaining two interactions the weak and strong nuclear forces  decline very rapidly with distance their effects are confined mainly to sub-atomic length scales the universe appears to have much more matter than antimatter  an asymmetry possibly related to the cp violation   this imbalance between matter and antimatter is partially responsible for the existence of all matter existing today since matter and antimatter if equally produced at the big bang  would have completely annihilated each other and left only photons as a result of their interaction   the universe also appears to have neither net momentum nor angular momentum  which follows accepted physical laws if the universe is finite these laws are gauss law and the non-divergence of the stress-energy-momentum pseudotensor   this diagram shows earth location in the universe on increasingly larger scales the images labeled along their left edge increase in size from left to right then from top to bottom observational cosmology television signals according to the general theory of relativity far regions of space may never interact with ours even in the lifetime of the universe due to the finite speed of light and the ongoing expansion of space  for example radio messages sent from earth may never reach some regions of space even if the universe were to exist forever space may expand faster than light can traverse it  the spatial region that can be observed with telescopes is called the observable universe  which depends on the location of the observer
the proper distance the distance as would be measured at a specific time including the presentbetween earth and the edge of the observable universe is billion light-years   billion parsecs  making the diameter of the observable universe about billion light-years  billion parsecs  the distance the light from the edge of the observable universe has travelled is very close to the age of the universe times the speed of light  light-years  pc but this does not represent the distance at any given time because the edge of the observable universe and the earth have since moved further apart  for comparison the diameter of a typical galaxy is  light-years  parsecs  and the typical distance between two neighboring galaxies is million light-years  kiloparsecs  as an example the milky way is roughly  light-years in diameter   and the nearest sister galaxy to the milky way the andromeda galaxy  is located roughly  million light-years away  because we cannot observe space beyond the edge of the observable universe it is unknown whether the size of the universe in its totality is finite or infinite    estimates suggest that the whole universe if finite must be more than times larger than the observable universe  some disputed  estimates for the total size of the universe if finite reach as high as megaparsecs as implied by a suggested resolution of the no-boundary proposal  b age of the universe metric expansion of space astronomers calculate the age of the universe by assuming that the lambda-cdm model accurately describes the evolution of the universe from a very uniform hot dense primordial state to its present state and measuring the cosmological parameters which constitute the model this model is well understood theoretically and supported by recent high-precision astronomical observations such as wmap and planck  commonly the set of observations fitted includes the cosmic microwave background anisotropy the brightnessredshift relation for type ia supernovae  and large-scale galaxy clustering including the baryon acoustic oscillation feature other observations such as the hubble constant the abundance of galaxy clusters weak gravitational lensing and globular cluster ages are generally consistent with these providing a check of the model but are less accurately measured at present assuming that the lambda-cdm model is correct the measurements of the parameters using a variety of techniques by numerous experiments yield a best value of the age of the universe as of of   billion years  milky way over time the universe and its contents have evolved for example the relative population of quasars and galaxies has changed  and space itself has expanded  due to this expansion scientists on earth can observe the light from a galaxy billion light-years away even though that light has traveled for only billion years the very space between them has expanded this expansion is consistent with the observation that the light from distant galaxies has been redshifted  the photons emitted have been stretched to longer wavelengths and lower frequency during their journey analyses of type ia supernovae indicate that the spatial expansion is accelerating    the more matter there is in the universe the stronger the mutual gravitational pull of the matter if the universe were dense then it would re-collapse into a gravitational singularity  however if the universe contained too matter then the self-gravity would be too weak for astronomical structures like galaxies or planets to form since the big bang the universe has expanded monotonically  perhaps unsurprisingly  our universe has just the right mass-energy density  equivalent to about protons per cubic metre which has allowed it to expand for the last  billion years giving time to form the universe as observed today  there are dynamical forces acting on the particles in the universe which affect the expansion rate before  it was expected that the expansion rate would be decreasing as time went on due to the influence of gravitational interactions in the universe and thus there is an additional observable quantity in the universe called the deceleration parameter  which most cosmologists expected to be positive and related to the matter density of the universe in  the deceleration parameter was measured by two different groups to be negative approximately - which technically implies that the second derivative of the cosmic scale factor has been positive in the last - billion years   this acceleration does not however imply that the hubble parameter is currently increasing see deceleration parameter for details spacetime world line lorentz transformation spacetimes are the arenas in which all physical events take place the basic elements of spacetimes are events  in any given spacetime an event is defined as a unique position at a unique time a spacetime is the union of all events in the same way that a line is the union of all of its points formally organized into a manifold   events such as matter and energy bend spacetime curved spacetime on the other hand forces matter and energy to behave in a certain way there is no point in considering one without the other  the universe appears to be a smooth spacetime continuum consisting of three spatial dimensions and one temporal  time  dimension an event in the spacetime of the physical universe can therefore be identified by a set of four coordinates  on average space is observed to be very nearly flat with a curvature close to zero meaning that euclidean geometry is empirically true with high accuracy throughout most of the universe  spacetime also appears to have a simply connected topology  in analogy with a sphere at least on the length-scale of the observable universe however present observations cannot exclude the possibilities that the universe has more dimensions which is postulated by theories such as the string theory  and that its spacetime may have a multiply connected global topology in analogy with the cylindrical or toroidal topologies of two-dimensional spaces    the spacetime of the universe is usually interpreted from a euclidean perspective with space as consisting of three dimensions  and time as consisting of one dimension  the  fourth dimension   by combining space and time into a single manifold called minkowski space  physicists have simplified a large number of physical theories  as well as described in a more uniform way the workings of the universe at both the supergalactic and subatomic levels spacetime events are not absolutely defined spatially and temporally but rather are known to be relative to the motion of an observer  minkowski space approximates the universe without gravity  the pseudo-riemannian manifolds of general relativity describe spacetime with matter and gravity shape of the universe general relativity describes how spacetime is curved and bent by mass and energy gravity the topology or geometry of the universe includes both local geometry in the observable universe and global geometry  cosmologists often work with a given space-like slice of spacetime called the comoving coordinates  the section of spacetime which can be observed is the backward light cone  which delimits the cosmological horizon  the cosmological horizon also called the particle horizon or the light horizon is the maximum distance from which particles can have traveled to the observer in the age of the universe  this horizon represents the boundary between the observable and the unobservable regions of the universe   the existence properties and significance of a cosmological horizon depend on the particular cosmological model  an important parameter determining the future evolution of the universe theory is the density parameter  omega  defined as the average matter density of the universe divided by a critical value of that density this selects one of three possible geometries depending on whether is equal to less than or greater than  these are called respectively the flat open and closed universes  observations including the cosmic background explorer cobe wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe wmap and planck maps of the cmb suggest that the universe is infinite in extent with a finite age as described by the friedmannlematrerobertsonwalker flrw models     these flrw models thus support inflationary models and the standard model of cosmology describing a flat  homogeneous universe presently dominated by dark matter and dark energy    fine-tuned universe the universe may be  the fine-tuned universe hypothesis is the proposition that the conditions that allow the existence of observable life in the universe can only occur when certain universal fundamental physical constants lie within a very narrow range of values so that if any of several fundamental constants were only slightly different the universe would have been unlikely to be conducive to the establishment and development of matter  astronomical structures elemental diversity or life as it is understood  the proposition is discussed among philosophers  scientists  theologians  and proponents of creationism  galaxy formation and evolution galaxy cluster illustris project nebula the universe is composed almost completely of dark energy dark matter and ordinary matter  other contents are electromagnetic radiation estimated to constitute from  to close to  of the total mass-energy of the universe and antimatter     the proportions of all types of matter and energy have changed over the history of the universe  the total amount of electromagnetic radiation generated within the universe has decreased by  in the past billion years   today ordinary matter which includes atoms stars galaxies and life  accounts for only  of the contents of the universe  the present overall density of this type of matter is very low roughly  grams per cubic centimetre corresponding to a density of the order of only one proton for every four cubic metres of volume  the nature of both dark energy and dark matter is unknown dark matter a mysterious form of matter that has not yet been identified accounts for  of the cosmic contents dark energy which is the energy of empty space and is causing the expansion of the universe to accelerate accounts for the remaining  of the contents    filaments cold dark matter dark energy voids matter dark matter and dark energy are distributed homogeneously throughout the universe over length scales longer than million light-years or so  however over shorter length-scales matter tends to clump hierarchically many atoms are condensed into stars  most stars into galaxies most galaxies into clusters superclusters and finally large-scale galactic filaments  the observable universe countains as many as billion galaxies   and overall as many as an estimated stars   more stars than all the grains of sand on planet earth   typical galaxies range from dwarfs with as few as ten million    stars up to giants with one trillion    stars between the larger structures are voids  which are typically mpc  million ly in diameter the milky way is in the local group of galaxies which in turn is in the laniakea supercluster   this supercluster spans over million light-years while the local group spans over million light-years  the universe also has vast regions of relative emptiness the largest known void measures  billion ly  mpc across   the observable universe is isotropic on scales significantly larger than superclusters meaning that the statistical properties of the universe are the same in all directions as observed from earth the universe is bathed in highly isotropic microwave radiation that corresponds to a thermal equilibrium blackbody spectrum of roughly  kelvins   the hypothesis that the large-scale universe is homogeneous and isotropic is known as the cosmological principle   a universe that is both homogeneous and isotropic looks the same from all vantage points  and has no center  dark energy an explanation for why the expansion of the universe is accelerating remains elusive it is often attributed to dark energy an unknown form of energy that is hypothesized to permeate space  on a massenergy equivalence basis the density of dark energy  gcm  is much less than the density of ordinary matter or dark matter within galaxies however in the present dark-energy era it dominates the massenergy of the universe because it is uniform across space   two proposed forms for dark energy are the cosmological constant  a energy density filling space homogeneously  and scalar fields such as quintessence or moduli  quantities whose energy density can vary in time and space contributions from scalar fields that are constant in space are usually also included in the cosmological constant the cosmological constant can be formulated to be equivalent to vacuum energy  scalar fields having only a slight amount of spatial inhomogeneity would be difficult to distinguish from a cosmological constant dark matter dark matter is a hypothetical kind of matter that is invisible to the entire electromagnetic spectrum  but which accounts for most of the matter in the universe the existence and properties of dark matter are inferred from its gravitational effects on visible matter radiation and the large-scale structure of the universe other than neutrinos  a form of hot dark matter  dark matter has not been detected directly making it one of the greatest mysteries in modern astrophysics  dark matter neither emits nor absorbs light or any other electromagnetic radiation at any significant level dark matter is estimated to constitute  of the total massenergy and  of the total matter in the universe   matter the remaining  of the massenergy of the universe is ordinary matter that is atoms  ions  electrons and the objects they form this matter includes stars  which produce nearly all of the light we see from galaxies as well as interstellar gas in the interstellar and intergalactic media planets  and all the objects from everyday life that we can bump into touch or squeeze  as a matter of fact the great majority of ordinary matter in the universe is unseen since visible stars and gas inside galaxies and clusters account for less than per cent of the ordinary matter contribution to the mass-energy density of the universe  ordinary matter commonly exists in four states or phases  solid  liquid  gas  and plasma  however advances in experimental techniques have revealed other previously theoretical phases such as boseeinstein condensates and fermionic condensates  ordinary matter is composed of two types of elementary particles  quarks and leptons   for example the proton is formed of two up quarks and one down quark  the neutron is formed of two down quarks and one up quark and the electron is a kind of lepton an atom consists of an atomic nucleus  made up of protons and neutrons and electrons that orbit the nucleus because most of the mass of an atom is concentrated in its nucleus which is made up of baryons  astronomers often use the term to describe ordinary matter although a small fraction of this baryonic matter is electrons soon after the big bang  primordial protons and neutrons formed from the quarkgluon plasma of the early universe as it cooled below two trillion degrees a few minutes later in a process known as big bang nucleosynthesis  nuclei formed from the primordial protons and neutrons this nucleosynthesis formed lighter elements those with small atomic numbers up to lithium and beryllium  but the abundance of heavier elements dropped off sharply with increasing atomic number some boron may have been formed at this time but the next heavier element carbon  was not formed in significant amounts big bang nucleosynthesis shut down after about minutes due to the rapid drop in temperature and density of the expanding universe subsequent formation of heavier elements resulted from stellar nucleosynthesis and supernova nucleosynthesis   particle physics ordinary matter and the forces that act on matter can be described in terms of elementary particles   these particles are sometimes described as being fundamental since they have an unknown substructure and it is unknown whether or not they are composed of smaller and even more fundamental particles   of central importance is the standard model  a theory that is concerned with electromagnetic interactions and the weak and strong nuclear interactions  the standard model is supported by the experimental confirmation of the existence of particles that compose matter quarks and leptons  and their corresponding  antimatter  duals as well as the force particles that mediate interactions  the photon  the w and z bosons  and the gluon   the standard model predicted the existence of the recently discovered higgs boson  a particle that is a manifestation of a field within the universe that can endow particles with mass   because of its success in explaining a wide variety of experimental results the standard model is sometimes regarded as a theory of almost everything  the standard model does not however accommodate gravity a true force-particle theory of everything has not been attained  hadron a hadron is a composite particle made of quarks held together by the strong force  hadrons are categorized into two families baryons such as protons and neutrons  made of three quarks and mesons such as pions  made of one quark and one antiquark  of the hadrons protons are stable and neutrons bound within atomic nuclei are stable other hadrons are unstable under ordinary conditions and are thus insignificant constituents of the modern universe from approximately seconds after the big bang  during a period is known as the hadron epoch  the temperature of the universe had fallen sufficiently to allow quarks to bind together into hadrons and the mass of the universe was dominated by hadrons  initially the temperature was high enough to allow the formation of hadronanti-hadron pairs which kept matter and antimatter in thermal equilibrium  however as the temperature of the universe continued to fall hadronanti-hadron pairs were no longer produced most of the hadrons and anti-hadrons were then eliminated in particle-antiparticle annihilation reactions leaving a small residual of hadrons by the time the universe was about one second old  lepton a lepton is an elementary  half-integer spin particle that does not undergo strong interactions but is subject to the pauli exclusion principle  no two leptons of the same species can be in exactly the same state at the same time  two main classes of leptons exist charged leptons also known as the leptons and neutral leptons better known as neutrinos  electrons are stable and the most common charged lepton in the universe whereas muons and taus are unstable particle that quickly decay after being produced in high energy collisions such as those involving cosmic rays or carried out in particle accelerators    charged leptons can combine with other particles to form various composite particles such as atoms and positronium  the electron governs nearly all of chemistry  as it is found in atoms and is directly tied to all chemical properties  neutrinos rarely interact with anything and are consequently rarely observed neutrinos stream throughout the universe but rarely interact with normal matter  the lepton epoch was the period in the evolution of the early universe in which the leptons dominated the mass of the universe it started roughly second after the big bang  after the majority of hadrons and anti-hadrons annihilated each other at the end of the hadron epoch  during the lepton epoch the temperature of the universe was still high enough to create leptonanti-lepton pairs so leptons and anti-leptons were in thermal equilibrium approximately seconds after the big bang the temperature of the universe had fallen to the point where leptonanti-lepton pairs were no longer created  most leptons and anti-leptons were then eliminated in annihilation reactions leaving a small residue of leptons the mass of the universe was then dominated by photons as it entered the following photon epoch    photon epoch photino a photon is the quantum of light and all other forms of electromagnetic radiation  it is the force carrier for the electromagnetic force  even when static via virtual photons  the effects of this force are easily observable at the microscopic and at the macroscopic level because the photon has zero rest mass  this allows long distance interactions  like all elementary particles photons are currently best explained by quantum mechanics and exhibit waveparticle duality  exhibiting properties of waves and of particles  the photon epoch started after most leptons and anti-leptons were annihilated at the end of the lepton epoch about seconds after the big bang atomic nuclei were created in the process of nucleosynthesis which occurred during the first few minutes of the photon epoch for the remainder of the photon epoch the universe contained a hot dense plasma of nuclei electrons and photons about  years after the big bang the temperature of the universe fell to the point where nuclei could combine with electrons to create neutral atoms as a result photons no longer interacted frequently with matter and the universe became transparent the highly redshifted photons from this period form the cosmic microwave background tiny variations in temperature and density detectable in the cmb were the early seeds from which all subsequent structure formation took place  timeline of the big bang chronology of the universe big bang planck epoch grand unification epoch electroweak epoch inflationary epoch reheating baryogenesis quark epoch hadron epoch lepton epoch photon epoch big bang nucleosynthesis matter domination recombination dark ages habitable epoch reionization fate of the universe big crunch big rip heat death of the universe graphical timeline of the big bang solutions of the einstein field equations big bang ultimate fate of the universe general relativity is the geometric theory of gravitation published by albert einstein in and the current description of gravitation in modern physics  it is the basis of current cosmological models of the universe general relativity generalizes special relativity and newton law of universal gravitation  providing a unified description of gravity as a geometric property of space and time  or spacetime in particular the curvature of spacetime is directly related to the energy and momentum of whatever matter and radiation are present the relation is specified by the einstein field equations  a system of partial differential equations  in general relativity the distribution of matter and energy determines the geometry of spacetime which in turn describes the acceleration of matter therefore solutions of the einstein field equations describe the evolution of the universe combined with measurements of the amount type and distribution of matter in the universe the equations of general relativity describe the evolution of the universe over time  with the assumption of the cosmological principle that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic everywhere a specific solution of the field equations that describes the universe is the metric tensor called the friedmannlematrerobertsonwalker metric  where     correspond to a spherical coordinate system  this metric has only two undetermined parameters an overall dimensionless length scale factor describes the size scale of the universe as a function of time an increase in is the expansion of the universe   a curvature index describes the geometry the index is defined so that it can take only one of three values  corresponding to flat euclidean geometry   corresponding to a space of positive curvature  or  corresponding to a space of positive or negative curvature  the value of as a function of time depends upon and the cosmological constant   the cosmological constant represents the energy density of the vacuum of space and could be related to dark energy  the equation describing how varies with time is known as the friedmann equation after its inventor alexander friedmann   the solutions for depend on and  but some qualitative features of such solutions are general first and most importantly the length scale of the universe can remain constant if the universe is perfectly isotropic with positive curvature   and has one precise value of density everywhere as first noted by albert einstein   however this equilibrium is unstable because the universe is inhomogeneous on smaller scales must change over time when changes all the spatial distances in the universe change in tandem there is an overall expansion or contraction of space itself this accounts for the observation that galaxies appear to be flying apart the space between them is stretching the stretching of space also accounts for the apparent paradox that two galaxies can be billion light-years apart although they started from the same point  billion years ago  and never moved faster than the speed of light  second all solutions suggest that there was a gravitational singularity in the past when went to zero and matter and energy were infinitely dense it may seem that this conclusion is uncertain because it is based on the questionable assumptions of perfect homogeneity and isotropy the cosmological principle and that only the gravitational interaction is significant however the penrosehawking singularity theorems show that a singularity should exist for very general conditions hence according to einstein field equations grew rapidly from an unimaginably hot dense state that existed immediately following this singularity when had a small finite value this is the essence of the big bang model of the universe understanding the singularity of the big bang likely requires a quantum theory of gravity  which has not yet been formulated  third the curvature index determines the sign of the mean spatial curvature of spacetime  averaged over sufficiently large length scales greater than about a billion light-years  if  the curvature is positive and the universe has a finite volume  a universe with positive curvature is often visualized as a three-dimensional sphere embedded in a four-dimensional space conversely if is zero or negative the universe has an infinite volume  it may seem counter-intuitive that an infinite and yet infinitely dense universe could be created in a single instant at the big bang when  but exactly that is predicted mathematically when does not equal  by analogy an infinite plane has zero curvature but infinite area whereas an infinite cylinder is finite in one direction and a torus is finite in both a toroidal universe could behave like a normal universe with periodic boundary conditions  the ultimate fate of the universe is still unknown because it depends critically on the curvature index and the cosmological constant  if the universe were sufficiently dense would equal  meaning that its average curvature throughout is positive and the universe will eventually recollapse in a big crunch   possibly starting a new universe in a big bounce  conversely if the universe were insufficiently dense would equal or and the universe would expand forever cooling off and eventually reaching the big freeze and the heat death of the universe   modern data suggests that the rate of expansion of the universe is not decreasing as originally expected but increasing if this continues indefinitely the universe may eventually reach a big rip  observationally the universe appears to be flat    with an overall density that is very close to the critical value between recollapse and eternal expansion  multiverse many-worlds interpretation bubble universe theory parallel universe fiction eternal inflation some speculative theories have proposed that our universe is but one of a set of disconnected universes collectively denoted as the multiverse  challenging or enhancing more limited definitions of the universe   scientific multiverse models are distinct from concepts such as alternate planes of consciousness and simulated reality  max tegmark developed a four-part classification scheme for the different types of multiverses that scientists have suggested in response to various physics problems an example of such multiverses is the one resulting from the chaotic inflation model of the early universe  another is the multiverse resulting from the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics in this interpretation parallel worlds are generated in a manner similar to quantum superposition and decoherence  with all states of the wave functions being realized in separate worlds effectively in the many-worlds interpretation the multiverse evolves as a universal wavefunction  if the big bang that created our multiverse created an ensemble of multiverses the wave function of the ensemble would be entangled in this sense  the least controversial but still highly disputed category of multiverse in tegmark scheme is level i  the multiverses of this level are composed by distant spacetime events in our own universe tegmark and others  have argued that if space is infinite or sufficiently large and uniform identical instances of the history of earth entire hubble volume occur every so often simply by chance tegmark calculated that our nearest so-called doppelgnger  is metres away from us a double exponential function larger than a googolplex    however the arguments used are of speculative nature  additionally it would be impossible to scientifically verify the existence of an identical hubble volume it is possible to conceive of disconnected spacetimes each existing but unable to interact with one another   an easily visualized metaphor of this concept is a group of separate soap bubbles  in which observers living on one soap bubble cannot interact with those on other soap bubbles even in principle  according to one common terminology each soap bubble of spacetime is denoted as a  whereas our particular spacetime is denoted as   just as we call our moon moon  the entire collection of these separate spacetimes is denoted as the multiverse  with this terminology different are not causally connected to each other  in principle the other unconnected may have different dimensionalities and topologies of spacetime different forms of matter and energy  and different physical laws and physical constants  although such possibilities are purely speculative  others consider each of several bubbles created as part of chaotic inflation to be separate  though in this model these universes all share a causal origin  cosmology timeline of cosmological theories nicolaus copernicus copernican system philosophi naturalis principia mathematica beginnings of the scientific revolution historically there have been many ideas of the cosmos cosmologies and its origin cosmogonies theories of an impersonal universe governed by physical laws were first proposed by the greeks and indians  ancient chinese philosophy encompassed the notion of the universe including both all of space and all of time  over the centuries improvements in astronomical observations and theories of motion and gravitation led to ever more accurate descriptions of the universe the modern era of cosmology began with albert einstein general theory of relativity  which made it possible to quantitatively predict the origin evolution and conclusion of the universe as a whole most modern accepted theories of cosmology are based on general relativity and more specifically the predicted big bang   creation myth cosmogony religious cosmology many cultures have stories describing the origin of the world and universe  cultures generally regard these stories as having some truth  there are however many differing beliefs in how these stories apply amongst those believing in a supernatural origin ranging from a god directly creating the universe as it is now to a god just setting the wheels in motion for example via mechanisms such as the big bang and evolution  ethnologists and anthropologists who study myths have developed various classification schemes for the various themes that appear in creation stories   for example in one type of story the world is born from a world egg  such stories include the finnish epic poem kalevala  the chinese story of pangu or the indian brahmanda purana  in related stories the universe is created by a single entity emanating or producing something by him- or herself as in the tibetan buddhism concept of adi-buddha  the ancient greek story of gaia mother earth the aztec goddess coatlicue myth the ancient egyptian god atum story and the judeo-christian genesis creation narrative in which the abrahamic god created the universe in another type of story the universe is created from the union of male and female deities as in the maori story of rangi and papa  in other stories the universe is created by crafting it from pre-existing materials such as the corpse of a dead godas from tiamat in the babylonian epic enuma elish or from the giant ymir in norse mythology or from chaotic materials as in izanagi and izanami in japanese mythology  in other stories the universe emanates from fundamental principles such as brahman and prakrti  the creation myth of the serers   or the yin and yang of the tao  cosmology pre-socratic philosophy physics aristotle hindu cosmology islamic cosmology philosophy of space and time the pre-socratic greek philosophers and indian philosophers developed some of the earliest philosophical concepts of the universe   the earliest greek philosophers noted that appearances can be deceiving and sought to understand the underlying reality behind the appearances in particular they noted the ability of matter to change forms eg ice to water to steam and several philosophers proposed that all the physical materials in the world are different forms of a single primordial material or arche  the first to do so was thales  who proposed this material to be water  thales student anaximander  proposed that everything came from the limitless apeiron  anaximenes proposed the primordial material to be air on account of its perceived attractive and repulsive qualities that cause the to condense or dissociate into different forms anaxagoras proposed the principle of nous mind while heraclitus proposed fire and spoke of logos  empedocles proposed the elements to be earth water air and fire his four-element model became very popular like pythagoras  plato believed that all things were composed of number  with empedocles elements taking the form of the platonic solids  democritus  and later philosophersmost notably leucippus proposed that the universe is composed of indivisible atoms moving through a void  vacuum  although aristotle did not believe that to be feasible because air like water offers resistance to motion  air will immediately rush in to fill a void and moreover without resistance it would do so indefinitely fast  although heraclitus argued for eternal change his contemporary parmenides made the radical suggestion that all change is an illusion that the true underlying reality is eternally unchanging and of a single nature parmenides denoted this reality as the one parmenides idea seemed implausible to many greeks but his student zeno of elea challenged them with several famous paradoxes  aristotle responded to these paradoxes by developing the notion of a potential countable infinity as well as the infinitely divisible continuum unlike the eternal and unchanging cycles of time he believed that the world is bounded by the celestial spheres and that cumulative stellar magnitude is only finitely multiplicative the indian philosopher kanada  founder of the vaisheshika school developed a notion of atomism and proposed that light and heat were varieties of the same substance  in the century ad the buddhist atomist philosopher dignga proposed atoms to be point-sized durationless and made of energy they denied the existence of substantial matter and proposed that movement consisted of momentary flashes of a stream of energy  the notion of temporal finitism was inspired by the doctrine of creation shared by the three abrahamic religions  judaism  christianity and islam  the christian philosopher  john philoponus  presented the philosophical arguments against the ancient greek notion of an infinite past and future philoponus arguments against an infinite past were used by the early muslim philosopher  al-kindi alkindus the jewish philosopher  saadia gaon saadia ben joseph and the muslim theologian  al-ghazali algazel  history of astronomy timeline of astronomy aristarchus astronomical models of the universe were proposed soon after astronomy began with the babylonian astronomers  who viewed the universe as a flat disk floating in the ocean and this forms the premise for early greek maps like those of anaximander and hecataeus of miletus  later greek philosophers observing the motions of the heavenly bodies were concerned with developing models of the universe-based more profoundly on empirical evidence  the first coherent model was proposed by eudoxus of cnidos  according to aristotle physical interpretation of the model celestial spheres eternally rotate with uniform motion around a stationary earth normal matter is entirely contained within the terrestrial sphere de mundo composed before bc or between and bc stated five elements situated in spheres in five regions the less being in each case surrounded by the greaternamely earth surrounded by water water by air air by fire and fire by ethermake up the whole universe  this model was also refined by callippus and after concentric spheres were abandoned it was brought into nearly perfect agreement with astronomical observations by ptolemy  the success of such a model is largely due to the mathematical fact that any function such as the position of a planet can be decomposed into a set of circular functions the fourier modes  other greek scientists such as the pythagorean philosopher philolaus  postulated according to stobaeus account that at the center of the universe was a central fire around which the earth  sun  moon and planets revolved in uniform circular motion  the greek astronomer aristarchus of samos was the first known individual to propose a heliocentric model of the universe though the original text has been lost a reference in archimedes  book the sand reckoner describes aristarchus heliocentric model archimedes wrote you king gelon are aware the universe is the name given by most astronomers to the sphere the center of which is the center of the earth while its radius is equal to the straight line between the center of the sun and the center of the earth this is the common account as you have heard from astronomers but aristarchus has brought out a book consisting of certain hypotheses wherein it appears as a consequence of the assumptions made that the universe is many times greater than the universe just mentioned his hypotheses are that the fixed stars and the sun remain unmoved that the earth revolves about the sun on the circumference of a circle the sun lying in the middle of the orbit and that the sphere of fixed stars situated about the same center as the sun is so great that the circle in which he supposes the earth to revolve bears such a proportion to the distance of the fixed stars as the center of the sphere bears to its surface aristarchus thus believed the stars to be very far away and saw this as the reason why stellar parallax had not been observed that is the stars had not been observed to move relative each other as the earth moved around the sun the stars are in fact much farther away than the distance that was generally assumed in ancient times which is why stellar parallax is only detectable with precision instruments the geocentric model consistent with planetary parallax was assumed to be an explanation for the unobservability of the parallel phenomenon stellar parallax the rejection of the heliocentric view was apparently quite strong as the following passage from plutarch suggests   cleanthes a contemporary of aristarchus and head of the stoics  thought it was the duty of the greeks to indict aristarchus of samos on the charge of impiety for putting in motion the hearth of the universe ie the earth  supposing the heaven to remain at rest and the earth to revolve in an oblique circle while it rotates at the same time about its own axis flammarion engraving the only other astronomer from antiquity known by name who supported aristarchus heliocentric model was seleucus of seleucia  a hellenistic astronomer who lived a century after aristarchus    according to plutarch seleucus was the first to prove the heliocentric system through reasoning  but it is not known what arguments he used seleucus arguments for a heliocentric cosmology were probably related to the phenomenon of tides   according to strabo  seleucus was the first to state that the tides are due to the attraction of the moon and that the height of the tides depends on the moon position relative to the sun  alternatively he may have proved heliocentricity by determining the constants of a geometric model for it and by developing methods to compute planetary positions using this model like what nicolaus copernicus later did in the century  during the middle ages  heliocentric models were also proposed by the indian astronomer aryabhata   and by the persian astronomers albumasar  and al-sijzi   model of the copernican universe thomas digges planets the aristotelian model was accepted in the western world for roughly two millennia until copernicus revived aristarchus perspective that the astronomical data could be explained more plausibly if the earth rotated on its axis and if the sun were placed at the center of the universe in the center rests the sun for who would place this lamp of a very beautiful temple in another or better place than this wherefrom it can illuminate everything at the same time as noted by copernicus himself the notion that the earth rotates is very old dating at least to philolaus c bc heraclides ponticus c bc and ecphantus the pythagorean  roughly a century before copernicus the christian scholar nicholas of cusa also proposed that the earth rotates on its axis in his book   al-sijzi  also proposed that the earth rotates on its axis empirical evidence for the earth rotation on its axis using the phenomenon of comets  was given by tusi  and ali qushji   this cosmology was accepted by isaac newton  christiaan huygens and later scientists  edmund halley   and jean-philippe de chseaux   noted independently that the assumption of an infinite space filled uniformly with stars would lead to the prediction that the nighttime sky would be as bright as the sun itself this became known as olbers paradox in the century  newton believed that an infinite space uniformly filled with matter would cause infinite forces and instabilities causing the matter to be crushed inwards under its own gravity  this instability was clarified in by the jeans instability criterion  one solution to these paradoxes is the charlier universe  in which the matter is arranged hierarchically systems of orbiting bodies that are themselves orbiting in a larger system  in a fractal way such that the universe has a negligibly small overall density such a cosmological model had also been proposed earlier in by johann heinrich lambert    a significant astronomical advance of the century was the realization by thomas wright  immanuel kant and others of nebulae   in  when the hooker telescope was completed the prevailing view still was that the universe consisted entirely of the milky way galaxy using the hooker telescope edwin hubble identified cepheid variables in several spiral nebulae and in proved conclusively that andromeda nebula and triangulum among others were entire galaxies outside our own thus proving that universe consists of a multitude of galaxies

propound physical theories suggestively similar to those of greece  kanada founder of the vaisheshika philosophy held that the world is composed of atoms as many in kind as the various elements the jains more nearly approximated to democritus by teaching that all atoms were of the same kind producing different effects by diverse modes of combinations kanada believed light and heat to be varieties of the same substance udayana taught that all heat comes from the sun and vachaspati  like newton  interpreted light as composed of minute particles emitted by substances and striking the eye  the buddhists denied the existence of substantial matter altogether movement consists for them of moments it is a staccato movement momentary flashes of a stream of energy everything is

which are imagined as absolute qualities or things possessing only one unique quality they are called qualities   in both systems in the sense of absolute qualities a kind of atomic or intra-atomic energies of which the empirical things are composed both systems therefore agree in denying the objective reality of the categories of substance and quality and of the relation of inference uniting them there is in snkhya philosophy no separate existence of qualities what we call quality is but a particular manifestation of a subtle entity to every new unit of quality corresponds a subtle quantum of matter which is called  quality but represents a subtle substantive entity the same applies to early buddhism where all qualities are substantive or more precisely dynamic entities although

heliopause is the point at which pressure from the solar wind is equal to the opposing pressure of the interstellar medium  it extends out to the edge of the scattered disc the oort cloud  which is thought to be the source for long-period comets  may also exist at a distance roughly a thousand times further than the heliosphere the solar system is located in the orion arm   light-years from the center of the milky way galaxy  contents discovery and exploration of the solar system andreas cellarius for most of history humanity did not recognize or understand the concept of the solar system most people up to the late middle ages renaissance believed earth to be stationary at the centre of the universe and categorically different from the divine or ethereal objects that moved through the sky although the greek philosopher aristarchus of samos had speculated on a heliocentric reordering of the cosmos nicolaus copernicus was the first to develop a mathematically predictive heliocentric system    in the century galileo discovered that the sun was marked with sunspots and that jupiter had four satellites in orbit around it  christiaan huygens followed on from galileo discoveries by discovering saturn moon titan and the shape of the rings of saturn   around  edmond halley observed a transit of mercury across the sun leading him to realise that observations of the solar parallax of a planet more ideally using the transit of venus  could be used to trigonometrically determine the distances between earth venus  and the sun  in  halley realised that repeated sightings of a comet were of the same object returning regularly once every years this was the first evidence that anything other than the planets orbited the sun  though this had been theorized about comets in the century by seneca   around  the term solar system first appeared in english  in  friedrich bessel successfully measured a stellar parallax  an apparent shift in the position of a star created by earth motion around the sun providing the first direct experimental proof of heliocentrism  improvements in observational astronomy and the use of uncrewed spacecraft have since enabled the detailed investigation of other bodies orbiting the sun comprehensive overview of the solar system the principal component of the solar system is the sun a main-sequence star that contains  of the system known mass and dominates it gravitationally  the sun four largest orbiting bodies the giant planets  account for  of the remaining mass with jupiter and saturn together comprising more than  the remaining objects of the solar system including the four terrestrial planets  the dwarf planets  moons  asteroids  and comets  together comprise less than  of the solar system total mass g most large objects in orbit around the sun lie near the plane of earth orbit known as the ecliptic  the planets are very close to the ecliptic whereas comets and kuiper belt objects are frequently at significantly greater angles to it   as a result of the formation of the solar system  planets and most other objects orbit the sun in the same direction that the sun is rotating counter-clockwise as viewed from above earth north pole  there are exceptions  such as halley comet  most of the larger moons orbit their planets in this prograde direction with triton being the largest exception and most larger objects rotate themselves in the same direction with venus being a notable exception the overall structure of the charted regions of the solar system consists of the sun four relatively small inner planets surrounded by a belt of mostly rocky asteroids and four giant planets surrounded by the kuiper belt of mostly icy objects astronomers sometimes informally divide this structure into separate regions the inner solar system includes the four terrestrial planets and the asteroid belt the outer solar system is beyond the asteroids including the four giant planets  since the discovery of the kuiper belt the outermost parts of the solar system are considered a distinct region consisting of the objects beyond neptune  most of the planets in the solar system have secondary systems of their own being orbited by planetary objects called natural satellites  or moons two of which titan and ganymede  are larger than the planet mercury  the four giant planets have planetary rings  thin bands of tiny particles that orbit them in unison most of the largest natural satellites are in synchronous rotation  with one face permanently turned toward their parent  ecliptic inner planets kepler laws of planetary motion describe the orbits of objects about the sun following kepler laws each object travels along an ellipse with the sun at one focus  objects closer to the sun with smaller semi-major axes  travel more quickly because they are more affected by the sun gravity on an elliptical orbit a body distance from the sun varies over the course of its year a body closest approach to the sun is called its perihelion  whereas its most distant point from the sun is called its aphelion  the orbits of the planets are nearly circular but many comets asteroids and kuiper belt objects follow highly elliptical orbits the positions of the bodies in the solar system can be predicted using numerical models  although the sun dominates the system by mass it accounts for only about  of the angular momentum    the planets dominated by jupiter account for most of the rest of the angular momentum due to the combination of their mass orbit and distance from the sun with a possibly significant contribution from comets  the sun which comprises nearly all the matter in the solar system is composed of roughly  hydrogen and helium  jupiter and saturn  which comprise nearly all the remaining matter are also primarily composed of hydrogen and helium   a composition gradient exists in the solar system created by heat and light pressure from the sun those objects closer to the sun which are more affected by heat and light pressure are composed of elements with high melting points objects farther from the sun are composed largely of materials with lower melting points  the boundary in the solar system beyond which those volatile substances could condense is known as the frost line  and it lies at roughly au from the sun  the objects of the inner solar system are composed mostly of rock  the collective name for compounds with high melting points such as silicates  iron or nickel that remained solid under almost all conditions in the protoplanetary nebula   jupiter and saturn are composed mainly of gases the astronomical term for materials with extremely low melting points and high vapour pressure  such as hydrogen  helium  and neon  which were always in the gaseous phase in the nebula  ices like water  methane  ammonia  hydrogen sulfide  and carbon dioxide   have melting points up to a few hundred kelvins  they can be found as ices liquids or gases in various places in the solar system whereas in the nebula they were either in the solid or gaseous phase  icy substances comprise the majority of the satellites of the giant planets as well as most of uranus and neptune the so-called  ice giants  and the numerous small objects that lie beyond neptune orbit   together gases and ices are referred to as volatiles   sun planets the distance from earth to the sun is astronomical unit au  km   mi  for comparison the radius of the sun is   thus the sun occupies    of the volume of a sphere with a radius the size of earth orbit whereas earth volume is roughly one millionth   that of the sun jupiter the largest planet is  astronomical units  from the sun and has a radius of   whereas the most distant planet neptune is  km from the sun with a few exceptions the farther a planet or belt is from the sun the larger the distance between its orbit and the orbit of the next nearer object to the sun for example venus is approximately  au farther out from the sun than mercury whereas saturn is  au out from jupiter and neptune lies  au out from uranus attempts have been made to determine a relationship between these orbital distances for example the titiusbode law   but no such theory has been accepted some solar system models attempt to convey the relative scales involved in the solar system on human terms some are small in scale and may be mechanicalcalled orreries whereas others extend across cities or regional areas  the largest such scale model the sweden solar system  uses the -metre  ericsson globe in stockholm as its substitute sun and following the scale jupiter is a -metre -foot sphere at stockholm arlanda airport   away whereas the farthest current object sedna  is a  sphere in lule   away   if the sunneptune distance is scaled to metres then the sun would be about in diameter roughly two-thirds the diameter of a golf ball the giant planets would be all smaller than about  and earth diameter along with that of the other terrestrial planets would be smaller than a flea  at this scale  distances of selected bodies of the solar system from the sun the left and right edges of each bar correspond to the perihelion and aphelion of the body respectively hence long bars denote high orbital eccentricity  the radius of the sun is  million km and the radius of jupiter the largest planet is  million km both too small to resolve on this image protoplanetary disk formation and evolution of the solar system the solar system formed  years ago from the gravitational collapse of a region within a large molecular cloud  h this initial cloud was likely several light-years across and probably birthed several stars  as is typical of molecular clouds this one consisted mostly of hydrogen with some helium and small amounts of heavier elements fused by previous generations of stars as the region that would become the solar system known as the pre-solar nebula   collapsed conservation of angular momentum caused it to rotate faster the centre where most of the mass collected became increasingly hotter than the surrounding disc  as the contracting nebula rotated faster it began to flatten into a protoplanetary disc with a diameter of roughly au  and a hot dense protostar at the centre   the planets formed by accretion from this disc  in which dust and gas gravitationally attracted each other coalescing to form ever larger bodies hundreds of protoplanets may have existed in the early solar system but they either merged or were destroyed leaving the planets dwarf planets and leftover minor bodies   contact binary arrokoth planetesimal contact binary protoplanets  due to their higher boiling points only metals and silicates could exist in solid form in the warm inner solar system close to the sun and these would eventually form the rocky planets of mercury venus earth and mars because metallic elements only comprised a very small fraction of the solar nebula the terrestrial planets could not grow very large the giant planets jupiter saturn uranus and neptune formed further out beyond the frost line the point between the orbits of mars and jupiter where material is cool enough for volatile icy compounds to remain solid the ices that formed these planets were more plentiful than the metals and silicates that formed the terrestrial inner planets allowing them to grow massive enough to capture large atmospheres of hydrogen and helium the lightest and most abundant elements leftover debris that never became planets congregated in regions such as the asteroid belt  kuiper belt  and oort cloud   the nice model is an explanation for the creation of these regions and how the outer planets could have formed in different positions and migrated to their current orbits through various gravitational interactions  within million years the pressure and density of hydrogen in the centre of the protostar became great enough for it to begin thermonuclear fusion   the temperature reaction rate pressure and density increased until hydrostatic equilibrium was achieved the thermal pressure equalled the force of gravity at this point the sun became a main-sequence star  the main-sequence phase from beginning to end will last about years for the sun compared to around two billion years for all other phases of the sun pre- remnant life combined  solar wind from the sun created the heliosphere and swept away the remaining gas and dust from the protoplanetary disc into interstellar space ending the planetary formation process the sun is growing brighter early in its main-sequence life its brightness was  that of what it is today  the solar system will remain roughly as we know it today until the hydrogen in the core of the sun has been entirely converted to helium which will occur roughly years from now this will mark the end of the sun main-sequence life at that time the core of the sun will contract with hydrogen fusion occurring along a shell surrounding the inert helium and the energy output will be much greater than at present the outer layers of the sun will expand to roughly times its current diameter and the sun will become a red giant  because of its vastly increased surface area the surface of the sun will be considerably cooler  k at its coolest than it is on the main sequence  the expanding sun is expected to vaporize mercury and render earth uninhabitable eventually the core will be hot enough for helium fusion the sun will burn helium for a fraction of the time it burned hydrogen in the core the sun is not massive enough to commence the fusion of heavier elements and nuclear reactions in the core will dwindle its outer layers will move away into space leaving a white dwarf  an extraordinarily dense object half the original mass of the sun but only the size of earth  the ejected outer layers will form what is known as a planetary nebula  returning some of the material that formed the sunbut now enriched with heavier elements like carbonto the interstellar medium sun the sun is the solar system star and by far its most massive component its large mass  earth masses  which comprises  of all the mass in the solar system  produces temperatures and densities in its core high enough to sustain nuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium  making it a main-sequence star  this releases an enormous amount of energy  mostly radiated into space as electromagnetic radiation peaking in visible light   the sun is a -type main-sequence star  hotter main-sequence stars are more luminous the sun temperature is intermediate between that of the hottest stars and that of the coolest stars stars brighter and hotter than the sun are rare whereas substantially dimmer and cooler stars known as red dwarfs  make up  of the stars in the milky way   the sun is a population i star  it has a higher abundance of elements heavier than hydrogen and helium  metals  in astronomical parlance than the older population ii stars  elements heavier than hydrogen and helium were formed in the cores of ancient and exploding stars so the first generation of stars had to die before the universe could be enriched with these atoms the oldest stars contain few metals whereas stars born later have more this high metallicity is thought to have been crucial to the sun development of a planetary system because the planets form from the accretion of metals  interplanetary medium solar wind heliospheric current sheet the vast majority of the solar system consists of a near- vacuum known as the interplanetary medium  along with light  the sun radiates a continuous stream of charged particles a plasma  known as the solar wind  this stream of particles spreads outwards at roughly  kilometres per hour  creating a tenuous atmosphere that permeates the interplanetary medium out to at least heliosphere   activity on the sun surface such as solar flares and coronal mass ejections  disturbs the heliosphere creating space weather and causing geomagnetic storms   the largest structure within the heliosphere is the heliospheric current sheet  a spiral form created by the actions of the sun rotating magnetic field on the interplanetary medium   earth magnetic field stops its atmosphere from being stripped away by the solar wind  venus and mars do not have magnetic fields and as a result the solar wind is causing their atmospheres to gradually bleed away into space  coronal mass ejections and similar events blow a magnetic field and huge quantities of material from the surface of the sun the interaction of this magnetic field and material with earth magnetic field funnels charged particles into earth upper atmosphere where its interactions create aurorae seen near the magnetic poles  the heliosphere and planetary magnetic fields for those planets that have them partially shield the solar system from high-energy interstellar particles called cosmic rays  the density of cosmic rays in the interstellar medium and the strength of the sun magnetic field change on very long timescales so the level of cosmic-ray penetration in the solar system varies though by how much is unknown  the interplanetary medium is home to at least two disc-like regions of cosmic dust  the first the zodiacal dust cloud  lies in the inner solar system and causes the zodiacal light  it was likely formed by collisions within the asteroid belt brought on by gravitational interactions with the planets  the second dust cloud extends from about to about  and was probably created by similar collisions within the kuiper belt    the inner solar system is the region comprising the terrestrial planets and the asteroid belt   composed mainly of silicates and metals the objects of the inner solar system are relatively close to the sun the radius of this entire region is less than the distance between the orbits of jupiter and saturn this region is also within the frost line  which is a little less than au about km from the sun  terrestrial planet earth mars venus mercury orrery julian days the four terrestrial or inner planets have dense rocky compositions few or no moons  and no ring systems  they are composed largely of refractory minerals such as the silicateswhich form their crusts and mantles and metals such as iron and nickel which form their cores  three of the four inner planets venus earth and mars have atmospheres substantial enough to generate weather all have impact craters and tectonic surface features such as rift valleys and volcanoes the term should not be confused with inferior planet  which designates those planets that are closer to the sun than earth is ie mercury and venus mercury planet mercury  au from the sun is the closest planet to the sun and on average all seven other planets   the smallest planet in the solar system   mercury has no natural satellites besides impact craters its only known geological features are lobed ridges or rupes that were probably produced by a period of contraction early in its history  mercury very tenuous atmosphere consists of atoms blasted off its surface by the solar wind  its relatively large iron core and thin mantle have not yet been adequately explained hypotheses include that its outer layers were stripped off by a giant impact or that it was prevented from fully accreting by the young sun energy   venus venus  au from the sun is close in size to earth   and like earth has a thick silicate mantle around an iron core a substantial atmosphere and evidence of internal geological activity it is much drier than earth and its atmosphere is ninety times as dense venus has no natural satellites it is the hottest planet with surface temperatures over  most likely due to the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere  no definitive evidence of current geological activity has been detected on venus but it has no magnetic field that would prevent depletion of its substantial atmosphere which suggests that its atmosphere is being replenished by volcanic eruptions  earth earth  au from the sun is the largest and densest of the inner planets the only one known to have current geological activity and the only place where life is known to exist  its liquid hydrosphere is unique among the terrestrial planets and it is the only planet where plate tectonics has been observed earth atmosphere is radically different from those of the other planets having been altered by the presence of life to contain  free oxygen   it has one natural satellite the moon  the only large satellite of a terrestrial planet in the solar system mars mars  from the sun is smaller than earth and venus   it has an atmosphere of mostly carbon dioxide with a surface pressure of  millibars roughly  of that of earth  its surface peppered with vast volcanoes such as olympus mons  and rift valleys such as valles marineris  shows geological activity that may have persisted until as recently as years ago  its red colour comes from iron oxide rust in its soil  mars has two tiny natural satellites  deimos and phobos  thought to be either captured asteroids   or ejected debris from a massive impact early in mars history  asteroid belt asteroid belt mars jupiter sun jupiter trojans planetary orbit asteroid belt hilda asteroids neos asteroids except for the largest ceres are classified as small solar system bodies f and are composed mainly of refractory rocky and metallic minerals with some ice   they range from a few metres to hundreds of kilometres in size asteroids smaller than one meter are usually called meteoroids and micrometeoroids grain-sized depending on different somewhat arbitrary definitions the asteroid belt occupies the orbit between mars and jupiter between from the sun it is thought to be remnants from the solar system formation that failed to coalesce because of the gravitational interference of jupiter  the asteroid belt contains tens of thousands possibly millions of objects over one kilometre in diameter  despite this the total mass of the asteroid belt is unlikely to be more than a thousandth of that of earth  the asteroid belt is very sparsely populated spacecraft routinely pass through without incident  ceres dwarf planet ceres  is the largest asteroid a protoplanet  and a dwarf planet f it has a diameter of slightly under  and a mass large enough for its own gravity to pull it into a spherical shape ceres was considered a planet when it was discovered in and was reclassified to asteroid in the as further observations revealed additional asteroids  it was classified as a dwarf planet in when the definition of a planet was created asteroids in the asteroid belt are divided into asteroid groups and families based on their orbital characteristics asteroid moons are asteroids that orbit larger asteroids they are not as clearly distinguished as planetary moons sometimes being almost as large as their partners the asteroid belt also contains main-belt comets  which may have been the source of earth water  jupiter trojans are located in either of jupiter l or l points gravitationally stable regions leading and trailing a planet in its orbit the term is also used for small bodies in any other planetary or satellite lagrange point hilda asteroids are in a  resonance with jupiter that is they go around the sun three times for every two jupiter orbits  the inner solar system also contains near-earth asteroids  many of which cross the orbits of the inner planets  some of them are potentially hazardous objects  the outer region of the solar system is home to the giant planets and their large moons the centaurs and many short-period comets also orbit in this region due to their greater distance from the sun the solid objects in the outer solar system contain a higher proportion of volatiles such as water ammonia and methane than those of the inner solar system because the lower temperatures allow these compounds to remain solid  giant planet jupiter saturn uranus neptune earth venus mars mercury orrery julian days the four outer planets or giant planets sometimes called jovian planets collectively make up  of the mass known to orbit the sun g jupiter and saturn are together more than times the mass of earth and consist overwhelmingly of the gases hydrogen and helium hence their designation as gas giants   uranus and neptune are far less massiveless than earth masses   eachand are composed primarily of ices for these reasons some astronomers suggest they belong in their own category ice giants   all four giant planets have rings  although only saturn ring system is easily observed from earth the term superior planet designates planets outside earth orbit and thus includes both the outer planets and mars jupiter jupiter  at  is  times the mass of all the other planets put together it is composed largely of hydrogen and helium  jupiter strong internal heat creates semi-permanent features in its atmosphere such as cloud bands and the great red spot  jupiter has known satellites  the four largest ganymede  callisto  io  and europa  show similarities to the terrestrial planets such as volcanism and internal heating  ganymede the largest satellite in the solar system is larger than mercury saturn saturn  distinguished by its extensive ring system  has several similarities to jupiter such as its atmospheric composition and magnetosphere although saturn has  of jupiter volume it is less than a third as massive at  saturn is the only planet of the solar system that is less dense than water  the rings of saturn are made up of small ice and rock particles saturn has confirmed satellites composed largely of ice two of these titan and enceladus  show signs of geological activity  titan the second-largest moon in the solar system is larger than mercury and the only satellite in the solar system with a substantial atmosphere uranus uranus  at  is the lightest of the outer planets uniquely among the planets it orbits the sun on its side its axial tilt is over ninety degrees to the ecliptic  it has a much colder core than the other giant planets and radiates very little heat into space  uranus has known satellites  the largest ones being titania  oberon  umbriel  ariel  and miranda   neptune neptune   though slightly smaller than uranus is more massive   and hence more dense  it radiates more internal heat but not as much as jupiter or saturn  neptune has known satellites  the largest triton  is geologically active with geysers of liquid nitrogen   triton is the only large satellite with a retrograde orbit  neptune is accompanied in its orbit by several minor planets  termed neptune trojans  that are in  resonance with it centaur minor planet the centaurs are icy comet-like bodies whose orbits have semi-major axes greater than jupiter  and less than neptune  the largest known centaur chariklo  has a diameter of about   the first centaur discovered chiron  has also been classified as a comet  because it develops a coma just as comets do when they approach the sun  halebopp comet comets are small solar system bodies f typically only a few kilometres across composed largely of volatile ices they have highly eccentric orbits generally a perihelion within the orbits of the inner planets and an aphelion far beyond pluto when a comet enters the inner solar system its proximity to the sun causes its icy surface to sublimate and ionise  creating a coma  a long tail of gas and dust often visible to the naked eye short-period comets have orbits lasting less than two hundred years long-period comets have orbits lasting thousands of years short-period comets are thought to originate in the kuiper belt whereas long-period comets such as halebopp  are thought to originate in the oort cloud  many comet groups such as the kreutz sungrazers  formed from the breakup of a single parent  some comets with hyperbolic orbits may originate outside the solar system but determining their precise orbits is difficult  old comets whose volatiles have mostly been driven out by solar warming are often categorised as asteroids  beyond the orbit of neptune lies the area of the  trans-neptunian region  with the doughnut-shaped kuiper belt home of pluto and several other dwarf planets and an overlapping disc of scattered objects which is tilted toward the plane of the solar system and reaches much further out than the kuiper belt the entire region is still largely unexplored  it appears to consist overwhelmingly of many thousands of small worldsthe largest having a diameter only a fifth that of earth and a mass far smaller than that of the mooncomposed mainly of rock and ice this region is sometimes described as the third zone of the solar system enclosing the inner and the outer solar system  kuiper belt kuiper belt sun jupiter trojans giant planets kuiper belt scattered disc neptune trojans tnos pluto its moons eris makemake haumea sedna gonggong quaoar orcus the kuiper belt is a great ring of debris similar to the asteroid belt but consisting mainly of objects composed primarily of ice  it extends between and from the sun though it is estimated to contain anything from dozens to thousands of dwarf planets it is composed mainly of small solar system bodies many of the larger kuiper belt objects such as quaoar  varuna  and orcus  may prove to be dwarf planets with further data there are estimated to be over  kuiper belt objects with a diameter greater than  but the total mass of the kuiper belt is thought to be only a tenth or even a hundredth the mass of earth  many kuiper belt objects have multiple satellites  and most have orbits that take them outside the plane of the ecliptic  the kuiper belt can be roughly divided into the  classical  belt and the resonances   resonances are orbits linked to that of neptune eg twice for every three neptune orbits or once for every two the first resonance begins within the orbit of neptune itself the classical belt consists of objects having no resonance with neptune and extends from roughly  to   members of the classical kuiper belt are classified as cubewanos  after the first of their kind to be discovered albion which previously had the provisional designation qb  and are still in near primordial low-eccentricity orbits  pluto charon moon the dwarf planet pluto with an average orbit of au is the largest known object in the kuiper belt when discovered in  it was considered to be the ninth planet this changed in with the adoption of a formal definition of planet  pluto has a relatively eccentric orbit inclined degrees to the ecliptic plane and ranging from  from the sun at perihelion within the orbit of neptune to  at aphelion pluto has a  resonance with neptune meaning that pluto orbits twice round the sun for every three neptunian orbits kuiper belt objects whose orbits share this resonance are called plutinos   charon the largest of pluto moons  is sometimes described as part of a binary system with pluto as the two bodies orbit a barycentre of gravity above their surfaces ie they appear to orbit each other beyond charon four much smaller moons styx  nix  kerberos  and hydra  orbit within the system makemake haumea makemake  average although smaller than pluto is the largest known object in the kuiper belt that is a kuiper belt object not in a confirmed resonance with neptune makemake is the brightest object in the kuiper belt after pluto it was assigned a naming committee under the expectation that it would prove to be a dwarf planet in   its orbit is far more inclined than pluto at   haumea  average is in an orbit similar to makemake except that it is in a temporary  orbital resonance with neptune  it was named under the same expectation that it would prove to be a dwarf planet though subsequent observations have indicated that it may not be a dwarf planet after all  scattered disc the scattered disc which overlaps the kuiper belt but extends out to about au is thought to be the source of short-period comets scattered-disc objects are thought to have been ejected into erratic orbits by the gravitational influence of neptune early outward migration  most scattered disc objects sdos have perihelia within the kuiper belt but aphelia far beyond it some more than from the sun sdos orbits are also highly inclined to the ecliptic plane and are often almost perpendicular to it some astronomers consider the scattered disc to be merely another region of the kuiper belt and describe scattered disc objects as scattered kuiper belt objects  some astronomers also classify centaurs as inward-scattered kuiper belt objects along with the outward-scattered residents of the scattered disc  eris dwarf planet eris with an average orbit of au is the largest known scattered disc object and caused a debate about what constitutes a planet because it is  more massive than pluto  and about the same diameter it is the most massive of the known dwarf planets it has one known moon dysnomia  like pluto its orbit is highly eccentric with a perihelion of  au roughly pluto distance from the sun and an aphelion of  au and steeply inclined to the ecliptic plane logarithmic scale astronomical units the point at which the solar system ends and interstellar space begins is not precisely defined because its outer boundaries are shaped by two forces the solar wind and the sun gravity the limit of the solar wind influence is roughly four times pluto distance from the sun this  the outer boundary of the heliosphere  is considered the beginning of the interstellar medium   the sun hill sphere  the effective range of its gravitational dominance is thought to extend up to a thousand times farther and encompasses the hypothetical oort cloud   heliosphere heliosphere interstellar medium the heliosphere is a stellar-wind bubble  a region of space dominated by the sun in which it radiates its solar wind at approximately s a stream of charged particles until it collides with the wind of the interstellar medium  the collision occurs at the  which is roughly from the sun upwind of the interstellar medium and roughly from the sun downwind  here the wind slows dramatically condenses and becomes more turbulent  forming a great oval structure known as the  this structure is thought to look and behave very much like a comet tail extending outward for a further on the upwind side but tailing many times that distance downwind evidence from the cassini and interstellar boundary explorer spacecraft has suggested that it is forced into a bubble shape by the constraining action of the interstellar magnetic field  the outer boundary of the heliosphere the  is the point at which the solar wind finally terminates and is the beginning of interstellar space  voyager and voyager are reported to have passed the termination shock and entered the heliosheath at and from the sun respectively   is reported to have crossed the heliopause in august   the shape and form of the outer edge of the heliosphere is likely affected by the fluid dynamics of interactions with the interstellar medium as well as solar magnetic fields prevailing to the south eg it is bluntly shaped with the northern hemisphere extending farther than the southern hemisphere  beyond the heliopause at around au lies the bow shock  a plasma wake left by the sun as it travels through the milky way   due to a lack of data conditions in local interstellar space are not known for certain it is expected that nasa voyager spacecraft  as they pass the heliopause will transmit valuable data on radiation levels and solar wind to earth  how well the heliosphere shields the solar system from cosmic rays is poorly understood a nasa-funded team has developed a concept of a vision mission dedicated to sending a probe to the heliosphere   detached object sednoid sedna with an average orbit of au is a large reddish object with a gigantic highly elliptical orbit that takes it from about at perihelion to at aphelion and takes  years to complete mike brown  who discovered the object in  asserts that it cannot be part of the scattered disc or the kuiper belt because its perihelion is too distant to have been affected by neptune migration he and other astronomers consider it to be the first in an entirely new population sometimes termed distant detached objects ddos which also may include the object cr  which has a perihelion of  an aphelion of  and an orbital period of  years  brown terms this population the inner oort cloud because it may have formed through a similar process although it is far closer to the sun  sedna is very likely a dwarf planet though its shape has yet to be determined the second unequivocally detached object with a perihelion farther than sedna at roughly au is vp  discovered in  its aphelion is only half that of sedna at au   oort cloud oort cloud the oort cloud is a hypothetical spherical cloud of up to a trillion icy objects that is thought to be the source for all long-period comets and to surround the solar system at roughly  around light-year ly and possibly to as far as   it is thought to be composed of comets that were ejected from the inner solar system by gravitational interactions with the outer planets oort cloud objects move very slowly and can be perturbed by infrequent events such as collisions the gravitational effects of a passing star or the galactic tide  the tidal force exerted by the milky way    vulcanoid planets beyond neptune planet nine much of the solar system is still unknown the sun gravitational field is estimated to dominate the gravitational forces of surrounding stars out to about two light-years  au lower estimates for the radius of the oort cloud by contrast do not place it farther than  au  despite discoveries such as sedna the region between the kuiper belt and the oort cloud an area tens of thousands of au in radius is still virtually unmapped there are also ongoing studies of the region between mercury and the sun  objects may yet be discovered in the solar system uncharted regions currently the furthest known objects such as comet west  have aphelia around  au from the sun but as the oort cloud becomes better known this may change milky way the solar system is located in the milky way  a barred spiral galaxy with a diameter of about  light-years containing more than stars  the sun resides in one of the milky way outer spiral arms known as the orioncygnus arm or local spur  the sun lies about  light-years from the galactic centre   and its speed around the center of the milky way is about s so that it completes one revolution every years this revolution is known as the solar system galactic year   the solar apex  the direction of the sun path through interstellar space is near the constellation hercules in the direction of the current location of the bright star vega   the plane of the ecliptic lies at an angle of about to the galactic plane  i the solar system location in the milky way is a factor in the evolutionary history of life on earth its orbit is close to circular and orbits near the sun are at roughly the same speed as that of the spiral arms   therefore the sun passes through arms only rarely because spiral arms are home to a far larger concentration of supernovae  gravitational instabilities and radiation that could disrupt the solar system this has given earth long periods of stability for life to evolve  however the changing position of the solar system relative to other parts of the milky way could explain periodic extinction events on earth according to the shiva hypothesis or related theories the solar system lies well outside the star-crowded environs of the galactic centre near the centre gravitational tugs from nearby stars could perturb bodies in the oort cloud and send many comets into the inner solar system producing collisions with potentially catastrophic implications for life on earth the intense radiation of the galactic centre could also interfere with the development of complex life  even at the solar system current location some scientists have speculated that recent supernovae may have adversely affected life in the last  years by flinging pieces of expelled stellar core towards the sun as radioactive dust grains and larger comet-like bodies  local interstellar cloud the solar system is in the local interstellar cloud or local fluff it is thought to be near the neighbouring g-cloud but it is not known if the solar system is embedded in the local interstellar cloud or if it is in the region where the local interstellar cloud and g-cloud are interacting   the local interstellar cloud is an area of denser cloud in an otherwise sparse region known as the local bubble  an hourglass-shaped cavity in the interstellar medium roughly light-years ly across the bubble is suffused with high-temperature plasma that suggests it is the product of several recent supernovae  there are relatively few stars within ten light-years of the sun  the closest is the triple star system alpha centauri  which is about  light-years away alpha centauri a and b are a closely tied pair of sun-like stars whereas the small red dwarf  proxima centauri  orbits the pair at a distance of  light-year in  a potentially habitable exoplanet was confirmed to be orbiting proxima centauri called proxima centauri b  the closest confirmed exoplanet to the sun  the stars next closest to the sun are the red dwarfs barnard star at  wolf  and lalande  the largest nearby star is sirius  a bright main-sequence star roughly  light-years away and roughly twice the sun mass and that is orbited by a white dwarf  sirius b the nearest brown dwarfs are the binary luhman system at  light-years other systems within ten light-years are the binary red-dwarf system luyten -  and the solitary red dwarf ross   the closest solitary sun-like star to the solar system is tau ceti at  light-years it has roughly  of the sun mass but only  of its luminosity  the closest known free-floating planetary-mass object to the sun is wise   an object with a mass less than jupiter masses roughly light-years away observable universe click here for an alternate image compared to many other planetary systems  the solar system stands out in lacking planets interior to the orbit of mercury   the known solar system also lacks super-earths  planet nine could be a super-earth beyond the known solar system  uncommonly it has only small rocky planets and large gas giants elsewhere planets of intermediate size are typicalboth rocky and gasso there is no gap as seen between the size of earth and of neptune with a radius  times as large also these super-earths have closer orbits than mercury  this led to the hypothesis that all planetary systems start with many close-in planets and that typically a sequence of their collisions causes consolidation of mass into few larger planets but in case of the solar system the collisions caused their destruction and ejection   the orbits of solar system planets are nearly circular compared to other systems they have smaller orbital eccentricity   although there are attempts to explain it partly with a bias in the radial-velocity detection method and partly with long interactions of a quite high number of planets the exact causes remain undetermined   this section is a sampling of solar system bodies selected for size and quality of imagery and sorted by volume

system  it is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma    heated to incandescence by nuclear fusion reactions in its core radiating the energy mainly as visible light and infrared radiation it is by far the most important source of energy for life on earth  its diameter is about  kilometres  miles or times that of earth its mass is about  times that of earth it accounts for about  of the total mass of the solar system  roughly three quarters of the sun mass consists of hydrogen  the rest is mostly helium  with much smaller quantities of heavier elements including oxygen  carbon  neon and iron   the sun is a g-type main-sequence star  based on its spectral class  as such it is informally and not completely accurately referred to as a yellow dwarf its light is closer to white than yellow it formed approximately  a   years ago from the gravitational collapse of matter within a region of a large molecular cloud  most of this matter gathered in the center whereas the rest flattened into an orbiting disk that became the solar system  the central mass became so hot and dense that it eventually initiated nuclear fusion in its core  it is thought that almost all stars form by this process  the sun core fuses about tons of hydrogen into helium every second converting tons of matter into energy every second as a result this energy which can take between  and  years to escape the core is the source of the sun light and heat when hydrogen fusion in its core has diminished to the point at which the sun is no longer in hydrostatic equilibrium  its core will undergo a marked increase in density and temperature while its outer layers expand eventually transforming the sun into a red giant  it is calculated that the sun will become sufficiently large to engulf the current orbits of mercury and venus  and render earth uninhabitable but not for about five billion years after this it will shed its outer layers and become a dense type of cooling star known as a white dwarf  and no longer produce energy by fusion but still glow and give off heat from its previous fusion the enormous effect of the sun on earth has been recognized since prehistoric times  the sun was thought of by some cultures as a deity  the synodic rotation of earth and its orbit around the sun are the basis of solar calendars  one of which is the gregorian calendar  the predominant calendar in use today contents the english word developed from old english  cognates appear in other germanic languages  including west frisian  dutch  low german  standard german  bavarian  old norse and gothic  all these words stem from proto-germanic sunnn   this is ultimately related to the word for sun in other branches of the indo-european language family though in most cases a nominative stem with an is found rather than the genitive stem in  as for example in latin  greek  welsh and russian pronounced  as well as with l   sanskrit and persian  indeed the -stem survived in proto-germanic as well as swelan which gave rise to gothic alongside  and old norse prosaic alongside poetic  and through it the words for sun in the modern scandinavian languages swedish and danish  icelandic  etc  in english the greek and latin words occur in poetry as personifications of the sun helios   and sol      while in science fiction sol may be used as a name for the sun to distinguish it from other stars the term  sol  with a lower-case  is used by planetary astronomers for the duration of a solar day on another planet such as mars   the principal adjectives for the sun in english are for sunlight and in technical contexts     from latin  the latter found in terms such as  solar eclipse and occasionally 
from the greek comes the rare adjective     the english weekday name sunday stems from old english sun day a germanic interpretation of the latin phrase dis  itself a translation of the greek hmera day of the sun  the sun is a g-type main-sequence star that comprises about  of the mass of the solar system the sun has an absolute magnitude of  estimated to be brighter than about  of the stars in the milky way  most of which are red dwarfs    the sun is a population i  or heavy-element-rich b star  the formation of the sun may have been triggered by shockwaves from one or more nearby supernovae   this is suggested by a high abundance of heavy elements in the solar system such as gold and uranium  relative to the abundances of these elements in so-called population ii  heavy-element-poor stars the heavy elements could most plausibly have been produced by endothermic nuclear reactions during a supernova or by transmutation through neutron absorption within a massive second-generation star  the sun is by far the brightest object in the earth sky  with an apparent magnitude of    this is about times brighter than the next brightest star sirius  which has an apparent magnitude of  one astronomical unit about   is defined as the mean distance of the sun center to earth center though the distance varies as earth moves from perihelion in january to aphelion in july  the distances can vary between  km perihelion and  km aphelion and extreme values can range from  km to  km  at its average distance light travels from the sun horizon to earth horizon in about minutes and seconds while light from the closest points of the sun and earth takes about two seconds less the energy of this sunlight supports almost all life c on earth by photosynthesis   and drives earth climate and weather the sun does not have a definite boundary but its density decreases exponentially with increasing height above the photosphere   for the purpose of measurement the sun radius is considered to be the distance from its center to the edge of the photosphere  the apparent visible surface of the sun  by this measure the sun is a near-perfect sphere with an oblateness estimated at about   which means that its polar diameter differs from its equatorial diameter by only kilometres   the tidal effect of the planets is weak and does not significantly affect the shape of the sun  the sun rotates faster at its equator than at its poles  this differential rotation is caused by convective motion due to heat transport and the coriolis force due to the sun rotation in a frame of reference defined by the stars the rotational period is approximately  days at the equator and  days at the poles viewed from earth as it orbits the sun the of the sun at its equator is about days  viewed from a vantage point above its north pole the sun rotates counterclockwise around its axis of spin d  sunlight the solar constant is the amount of power that the sun deposits per unit area that is directly exposed to sunlight the solar constant is equal to approximately watts per square meter at a distance of one astronomical unit au from the sun that is on or near earth  sunlight on the surface of earth is attenuated by earth atmosphere  so that less power arrives at the surface closer to  in clear conditions when the sun is near the zenith   sunlight at the top of earth atmosphere is composed by total energy of about  infrared light  visible light and  ultraviolet light  the atmosphere in particular filters out over  of solar ultraviolet especially at the shorter wavelengths  solar ultraviolet radiation ionizes earth dayside upper atmosphere creating the electrically conducting ionosphere   the sun emits light across the visible spectrum  so its color is white  with a cie color-space index near   when viewed from space or when the sun is high in the sky the solar radiance per wavelength peaks in the green portion of the spectrum when viewed from space   when the sun is low in the sky atmospheric scattering renders the sun yellow red orange or magenta despite its typical whiteness most people mentally picture the sun as yellow the reasons for this are the subject of debate  the sun is a star with indicating its surface temperature of approximately    and that it like most stars is a main-sequence star   the average luminance of the sun is about  candela per square metre  but as viewed through earth atmosphere this is lowered to about m  e however the luminance is not constant across the disk of the sun due to limb darkening  wiggle animation solar flare skylab molecules in stars the sun is composed primarily of the chemical elements hydrogen and helium  at this time in the sun life they account for  and  of the mass of the sun in the photosphere respectively  all heavier elements called metals in astronomy account for less than  of the mass with oxygen roughly  of the sun mass carbon  neon  and iron  being the most abundant  the sun original chemical composition was inherited from the interstellar medium out of which it formed originally it would have contained about  hydrogen  helium and  heavier elements  the hydrogen and most of the helium in the sun would have been produced by big bang nucleosynthesis in the first minutes of the universe and the heavier elements were produced by previous generations of stars before the sun was formed and spread into the interstellar medium during the final stages of stellar life and by events such as supernovae   since the sun formed the main fusion process has involved fusing hydrogen into helium over the past  years the amount of helium and its location within the sun has gradually changed within the core the proportion of helium has increased from about  to about  due to fusion and some of the helium and heavy elements have settled from the photosphere towards the center of the sun because of gravity  the proportions of metals heavier elements is unchanged heat is transferred outward from the sun core by radiation rather than by convection see radiative zone below so the fusion products are not lifted outward by heat they remain in the core  and gradually an inner core of helium has begun to form that cannot be fused because presently the sun core is not hot or dense enough to fuse helium in the current photosphere the helium fraction is reduced and the metallicity is only  of what it was in the protostellar phase before nuclear fusion in the core started in the future helium will continue to accumulate in the core and in about years this gradual build-up will eventually cause the sun to exit the main sequence and become a red giant   the chemical composition of the photosphere is normally considered representative of the composition of the primordial solar system  the solar heavy-element abundances described above are typically measured both using spectroscopy of the sun photosphere and by measuring abundances in meteorites that have never been heated to melting temperatures these meteorites are thought to retain the composition of the protostellar sun and are thus not affected by the settling of heavy elements the two methods generally agree well  in the  much re focused on the abundances of iron-group elements in the sun   although significant re was done until it was difficult to determine the abundances of some iron-group elements eg cobalt and manganese  via spectrography because of their hyperfine structures   the first largely complete set of oscillator strengths of singly ionized iron-group elements were made available in the   and these were subsequently improved  in  the abundances of singly ionized elements of the iron group were derived  various authors have considered the existence of a gradient in the isotopic compositions of solar and planetary noble gases   eg correlations between isotopic compositions of neon and xenon in the sun and on the planets  prior to  it was thought that the whole sun has the same composition as the solar atmosphere  in  it was claimed that it was fractionation in the sun itself that caused the isotopic-composition relationship between the planetary and solar-wind-implanted noble gases  standard solar model the structure of the sun contains the following layers core nuclear fusion radiative zone tachocline convective zone photosphere atmosphere chromosphere solar transition region corona heliosphere solar eclipse solar core the core of the sun extends from the center to about  of the solar radius  it has a density of up to   about times the density of water and a temperature of close to  kelvins k  by contrast the sun surface temperature is approximately  recent analysis of soho mission data favors a faster rotation rate in the core than in the radiative zone above  through most of the sun life energy has been produced by nuclear fusion in the core region through a series of nuclear reactions called the pp protonproton chain  this process converts hydrogen into helium  only  of the energy generated in the sun comes from another sequence of fusion reactions called the cno cycle  though this proportion is expected to increase as the sun becomes older   the core is the only region in the sun that produces an appreciable amount of thermal energy through fusion  of the power is generated within  of the sun radius and by  of the radius fusion has stopped nearly entirely the remainder of the sun is heated by this energy as it is transferred outwards through many successive layers finally to the solar photosphere where it escapes into space through radiation photons or advection massive particles   the protonproton chain occurs around times each second in the core converting about  protons into alpha particles helium nuclei every second out of a total of  free protons in the sun or about   fusing four free protons hydrogen nuclei into a single alpha particle helium nucleus releases around  of the fused mass as energy  so the sun releases energy at the massenergy conversion rate of  metric tons per second which requires metric megatons of hydrogen   for  yottawatts    or  megatons of tnt per second the large power output of the sun is mainly due to the huge size and density of its core compared to earth and objects on earth with only a fairly small amount of power being generated per cubic metre  theoretical models of the sun interior indicate a maximum power density or energy production of approximately  watts per cubic metre at the center of the core  which is about the same power density inside a compost pile   f the fusion rate in the core is in a self-correcting equilibrium a slightly higher rate of fusion would cause the core to heat up more and expand slightly against the weight of the outer layers reducing the density and hence the fusion rate and correcting the perturbation  and a slightly lower rate would cause the core to cool and shrink slightly increasing the density and increasing the fusion rate and again reverting it to its present rate   radiative zone from the core out to about  solar radii  thermal radiation is the primary means of energy transfer  the temperature drops from approximately to kelvins with increasing distance from the core  this temperature gradient is less than the value of the adiabatic lapse rate and hence cannot drive convection which explains why the transfer of energy through this zone is by radiation instead of thermal convection  ions of hydrogen and helium emit photons which travel only a brief distance before being reabsorbed by other ions  the density drops a hundredfold from gcm to  gcm  between  solar radii and  radii the top of the radiative zone  tachocline the radiative zone and the convective zone are separated by a transition layer the tachocline  this is a region where the sharp regime change between the uniform rotation of the radiative zone and the differential rotation of the convection zone results in a large shear between the twoa condition where successive horizontal layers slide past one another  presently it is hypothesized see solar dynamo  that a magnetic dynamo within this layer generates the sun magnetic field   convection zone the sun convection zone extends from  solar radii  to near the surface in this layer the solar plasma is not dense enough or hot enough to transfer the heat energy of the interior outward via radiation instead the density of the plasma is low enough to allow convective currents to develop and move the sun energy outward towards its surface material heated at the tachocline picks up heat and expands thereby reducing its density and allowing it to rise as a result an orderly motion of the mass develops into thermal cells that carry the majority of the heat outward to the sun photosphere above once the material diffusively and radiatively cools just beneath the photospheric surface its density increases and it sinks to the base of the convection zone where it again picks up heat from the top of the radiative zone and the convective cycle continues at the photosphere the temperature has dropped to  k and the density to only  gm about  the density of air at sea level  the thermal columns of the convection zone form an imprint on the surface of the sun giving it a granular appearance called the solar granulation at the smallest scale and supergranulation at larger scales turbulent convection in this outer part of the solar interior sustains small-scale dynamo action over the near-surface volume of the sun  the sun thermal columns are bnard cells and take the shape of roughly hexagonal prisms  photosphere effective temperature black body daniel k inouye solar telescope the visible surface of the sun the photosphere is the layer below which the sun becomes opaque to visible light  photons produced in this layer escape the sun through the transparent solar atmosphere above it and become solar radiation sunlight the change in opacity is due to the decreasing amount of h ions  which absorb visible light easily  conversely the visible light we see is produced as electrons react with hydrogen atoms to produce h ions   the photosphere is tens to hundreds of kilometers thick and is slightly less opaque than air on earth because the upper part of the photosphere is cooler than the lower part an image of the sun appears brighter in the center than on the edge or of the solar disk in a phenomenon known as limb darkening  the spectrum of sunlight has approximately the spectrum of a black-body radiating at k  interspersed with atomic absorption lines from the tenuous layers above the photosphere the photosphere has a particle density of  m about  of the particle number per volume of earth atmosphere at sea level the photosphere is not fully ionizedthe extent of ionization is about  leaving almost all of the hydrogen in atomic form  during early studies of the optical spectrum of the photosphere some absorption lines were found that did not correspond to any chemical elements then known on earth in  norman lockyer hypothesized that these absorption lines were caused by a new element that he dubbed  after the greek sun god helios  twenty-five years later helium was isolated on earth  solar corona coronal loop during a total solar eclipse when the disk of the sun is covered by that of the moon  parts of the sun surrounding atmosphere can be seen it is composed of four distinct parts the chromosphere the transition region the corona and the heliosphere the coolest layer of the sun is a temperature minimum region extending to about above the photosphere and has a temperature of about k   this part of the sun is cool enough to allow the existence of simple molecules such as carbon monoxide and water which can be detected via their absorption spectra  the chromosphere transition region and corona are much hotter than the surface of the sun  the reason is not well understood but evidence suggests that alfvn waves may have enough energy to heat the corona  above the temperature minimum layer is a layer about thick dominated by a spectrum of emission and absorption lines  it is called the from the greek root  meaning color because the chromosphere is visible as a colored flash at the beginning and end of total solar eclipses  the temperature of the chromosphere increases gradually with altitude ranging up to around near the top  in the upper part of the chromosphere helium becomes partially ionized   hinode above the chromosphere in a thin about  transition region the temperature rises rapidly from around in the upper chromosphere to coronal temperatures closer to   the temperature increase is facilitated by the full ionization of helium in the transition region which significantly reduces radiative cooling of the plasma  the transition region does not occur at a well-defined altitude rather it forms a kind of nimbus around chromospheric features such as spicules and filaments  and is in constant chaotic motion  the transition region is not easily visible from earth surface but is readily observable from space by instruments sensitive to the extreme ultraviolet portion of the spectrum   the corona is the next layer of the sun the low corona near the surface of the sun has a particle density around m to m   g the average temperature of the corona and solar wind is about  k however in the hottest regions it is  k  although no complete theory yet exists to account for the temperature of the corona at least some of its heat is known to be from magnetic reconnection    the corona is the extended atmosphere of the sun which has a volume much larger than the volume enclosed by the sun photosphere a flow of plasma outward from the sun into interplanetary space is the solar wind   the heliosphere the tenuous outermost atmosphere of the sun is filled with the solar wind plasma this outermost layer of the sun is defined to begin at the distance where the flow of the solar wind becomes that is where the flow becomes faster than the speed of alfvn waves  at approximately solar radii  au
turbulence and dynamic forces in the heliosphere cannot affect the shape of the solar corona within because the information can only travel at the speed of alfvn waves the solar wind travels outward continuously through the heliosphere   forming the solar magnetic field into a spiral shape  until it impacts the heliopause more than from the sun in december  the voyager probe passed through a shock front that is thought to be part of the heliopause  in late voyager recorded a marked increase in cosmic ray collisions and a sharp drop in lower energy particles from the solar wind which suggested that the probe had passed through the heliopause and entered the interstellar medium   and indeed did so august  at approximately astronomical units from the sun  the heliosphere has a heliotail which stretches out behind it due to the sun movement  solar irradiance high-energy gamma ray photons initially released with fusion reactions in the core are almost immediately absorbed by the solar plasma of the radiative zone usually after traveling only a few millimeters re-emission happens in a random direction and usually at slightly lower energy with this sequence of emissions and absorptions it takes a long time for radiation to reach the sun surface estimates of the photon travel time range between  and   in contrast it takes only  seconds for the neutrinos  which account for about  of the total energy production of the sun to reach the surface because energy transport in the sun is a process that involves photons in thermodynamic equilibrium with matter the time scale of energy transport in the sun is longer on the order of  years this is the time it would take the sun to return to a stable state if the rate of energy generation in its core were suddenly changed  neutrinos are also released by the fusion reactions in the core but unlike photons they rarely interact with matter so almost all are able to escape the sun immediately for many years measurements of the number of neutrinos produced in the sun were lower than theories predicted by a factor of  this discrepancy was resolved in through the discovery of the effects of neutrino oscillation  the sun emits the number of neutrinos predicted by the theory but neutrino detectors were missing of them because the neutrinos had changed flavor by the time they were detected  stellar magnetic field sunspots list of solar cycles solar phenomena butterfly diagram plasma heliospheric current sheet plasma interplanetary medium  the sun has a magnetic field that varies across its surface its polar field is gauss  t  whereas the field is typically  gauss  in features on the sun called sunspots and gauss  in solar prominences   the magnetic field varies in time and location the quasi-periodic -year solar cycle is the most prominent variation in which the number and size of sunspots waxes and wanes    sunspots are visible as dark patches on the sun photosphere and correspond to concentrations of magnetic field where the convective transport of heat is inhibited from the solar interior to the surface as a result sunspots are slightly cooler than the surrounding photosphere so they appear dark at a typical solar minimum  few sunspots are visible and occasionally none can be seen at all those that do appear are at high solar latitudes as the solar cycle progresses towards its maximum  sunspots tend to form closer to the solar equator a phenomenon known as sprer law  the largest sunspots can be tens of thousands of kilometers across  an -year sunspot cycle is half of a -year babcock leighton dynamo cycle which corresponds to an oscillatory exchange of energy between toroidal and poloidal solar magnetic fields at solar-cycle maximum the external poloidal dipolar magnetic field is near its dynamo-cycle minimum strength but an internal toroidal quadrupolar field generated through differential rotation within the tachocline is near its maximum strength at this point in the dynamo cycle buoyant upwelling within the convective zone forces emergence of the toroidal magnetic field through the photosphere giving rise to pairs of sunspots roughly aligned east-west and having footprints with opposite magnetic polarities the magnetic polarity of sunspot pairs alternates every solar cycle a phenomenon known as the hale cycle   during the solar cycle declining phase energy shifts from the internal toroidal magnetic field to the external poloidal field and sunspots diminish in number and size at solar-cycle minimum the toroidal field is correspondingly at minimum strength sunspots are relatively rare and the poloidal field is at its maximum strength with the rise of the next -year sunspot cycle differential rotation shifts magnetic energy back from the poloidal to the toroidal field but with a polarity that is opposite to the previous cycle the process carries on continuously and in an idealized simplified scenario each -year sunspot cycle corresponds to a change then in the overall polarity of the sun large-scale magnetic field   the solar magnetic field extends well beyond the sun itself the electrically conducting solar wind plasma carries the sun magnetic field into space forming what is called the interplanetary magnetic field   in an approximation known as ideal magnetohydrodynamics  plasma particles only move along the magnetic field lines as a result the outward-flowing solar wind stretches the interplanetary magnetic field outward forcing it into a roughly radial structure for a simple dipolar solar magnetic field with opposite hemispherical polarities on either side of the solar magnetic equator a thin current sheet is formed in the solar wind  at great distances the rotation of the sun twists the dipolar magnetic field and corresponding current sheet into an archimedean spiral structure called the parker spiral  the interplanetary magnetic field is much stronger than the dipole component of the solar magnetic field the sun dipole magnetic field of t at the photosphere reduces with the inverse-cube of the distance leading to a predicted magnetic field of  at the distance of earth however according to spacecraft observations the interplanetary field at earth location is around  about a hundredtimes greater  the difference is due to magnetic fields generated by electrical currents in the plasma surrounding the sun the sun magnetic field leads to many effects that are collectively called solar activity  solar flares and coronal-mass ejections tend to occur at sunspot groups slowly changing high-speed streams of solar wind are emitted from coronal holes at the photospheric surface both coronal-mass ejections and high-speed streams of solar wind carry plasma and interplanetary magnetic field outward into the solar system  the effects of solar activity on earth include auroras at moderate to high latitudes and the disruption of radio communications and electric power  solar activity is thought to have played a large role in the formation and evolution of the solar system  with solar-cycle modulation of sunspot number comes a corresponding modulation of space weather conditions including those surrounding earth where technological systems can be affected in december  a new type of solar magnetic explosion was observed known as forced magnetic reconnection  previously in a process called spontaneous magnetic reconnection  it was observed that the solar magnetic field lines diverge explosively and then converge again instantaneously forced magnetic reconnection was similar but it was triggered by an explosion in the corona  long-term secular change in sunspot number is thought by some scientists to be correlated with long-term change in solar irradiance  which in turn might influence earth long-term climate  for example in the century the solar cycle appeared to have stopped entirely for several decades few sunspots were observed during a period known as the maunder minimum  this coincided in time with the era of the little ice age  when europe experienced unusually cold temperatures  earlier extended minima have been discovered through analysis of tree rings and appear to have coincided with lower-than-average global temperatures  a recent theory claims that there are magnetic instabilities in the core of the sun that cause fluctuations with periods of either  or  years these could provide a better explanation of the ice ages than the milankovitch cycles    formation and evolution of the solar system stellar evolution the sun today is roughly halfway through the most stable part of its life it has not changed dramatically for over four billion a years and will remain fairly stable for more than five billion more however after hydrogen fusion in its core has stopped the sun will undergo dramatic changes both internally and externally the sun formed about  years ago from the collapse of part of a giant molecular cloud that consisted mostly of hydrogen and helium and that probably gave birth to many other stars  this age is estimated using computer models of stellar evolution and through nucleocosmochronology   the result is consistent with the radiometric date of the oldest solar system material at  years ago   studies of ancient meteorites reveal traces of stable daughter nuclei of short-lived isotopes such as iron-  that form only in exploding short-lived stars this indicates that one or more supernovae must have occurred near the location where the sun formed a shock wave from a nearby supernova would have triggered the formation of the sun by compressing the matter within the molecular cloud and causing certain regions to collapse under their own gravity  as one fragment of the cloud collapsed it also began to rotate due to conservation of angular momentum and heat up with the increasing pressure much of the mass became concentrated in the center whereas the rest flattened out into a disk that would become the planets and other solar system bodies gravity and pressure within the core of the cloud generated a lot of heat as it accumulated more matter from the surrounding disk eventually triggering nuclear fusion  hd and hd are hypothesized stellar siblings of the sun having formed in the same molecular cloud luminosity radius effective temperature  the sun is about halfway through its main-sequence stage during which nuclear fusion reactions in its core fuse hydrogen into helium each second more than four million tonnes of matter are converted into energy within the sun core producing neutrinos and solar radiation  at this rate the sun has so far converted around times the mass of earth into energy about  of the total mass of the sun the sun will spend a total of approximately years as a main-sequence star  the sun is gradually becoming hotter in its core hotter at the surface larger in radius and more luminous during its time on the main sequence since the beginning of its main sequence life it has expanded in radius by  and the surface has increased in temperature from to  resulting in a  increase in luminosity from  solar luminosities to its present-day  solar luminosity this occurs because the helium atoms in the core have a higher mean molecular weight than the hydrogen atoms that were fused resulting in less thermal pressure the core is therefore shrinking allowing the outer layers of the sun to move closer to the center releasing gravitational potential energy according to the virial theorem  half this released gravitational energy goes into heating which leads to a gradual increase in the rate at which fusion occurs and thus an increase in the luminosity this process speeds up as the core gradually becomes denser  at present it is increasing in brightness by about  every years  main sequence the sun does not have enough mass to explode as a supernova  instead when it runs out of hydrogen in the core in approximately years core hydrogen fusion will stop and there will be nothing to prevent the core from contracting the release of gravitational potential energy causes the luminosity of the star to increase ending the main sequence phase and leading the star to expand over the next billion years first into a subgiant  and then into a red giant     the heating due to gravitational contraction will also lead to hydrogen fusion in a shell just outside the core where unfused hydrogen remains contributing to the increased luminosity which will eventually reach more than times its present luminosity  as a red giant the sun will grow so large that it will engulf mercury venus and probably earth reaching about    the sun will spend around a billion years as a red-giant branch star and lose around a third of its mass  hertzsprungrussell diagram after the red-giant branch the sun has approximately years of active life left but much happens first the core full of degenerate helium ignites violently in the helium flash  where it is estimated that  of the core itself  of the sun mass will be converted into carbon within a matter of minutes through the triple-alpha process   the sun then shrinks to around times its current size and times the luminosity with a temperature a little lower than today it will then have reached the red clump or horizontal branch  but a star of the sun metallicity does not evolve blueward along the horizontal branch instead it just becomes moderately larger and more luminous over about years as it continues to react helium in the core  when the helium is exhausted the sun will repeat the expansion it followed when the hydrogen in the core was exhausted except that this time it all happens faster and the sun becomes larger and more luminous this is the asymptotic-giant-branch phase and the sun is alternately reacting hydrogen in a shell or helium in a deeper shell after about years on the early asymptotic giant branch the sun becomes increasingly unstable with rapid mass loss and thermal pulses that increase the size and luminosity for a few hundred years every  years or so the thermal pulses become larger each time with the later pulses pushing the luminosity to as much as  times the current level and the radius to over au  according to a model earth orbit will have initially expanded significantly due to the sun loss of mass as a red giant but will later start shrinking due to tidal forces and eventually drag from the lower chromosphere so that it is engulfed by the sun during the tip of the red-giant branch phase  and years after mercury and venus have respectively suffered the same fate models vary depending on the rate and timing of mass loss models that have higher mass loss on the red-giant branch produce smaller less luminous stars at the tip of the asymptotic giant branch perhaps only  times the luminosity and less than times the radius  for the sun four thermal pulses are predicted before it completely loses its outer envelope and starts to make a planetary nebula  by the end of that phaselasting approximately  yearsthe sun will only have about half of its current mass the post-asymptotic-giant-branch evolution is even faster the luminosity stays approximately constant as the temperature increases with the ejected half of the sun mass becoming ionized into a planetary nebula as the exposed core reaches  k as if it is in a sort of blue loop  the final naked core a white dwarf  will have a temperature of over  k and contain an estimated  of the sun present-day mass  the planetary nebula will disperse in about  years but the white dwarf will survive for trillions of years before fading to a hypothetical black dwarf    the sun lies close to the inner rim of the milky way orion arm  in the local interstellar cloud or the gould belt  at a distance of  kiloparsecs  from the galactic center        the sun is contained within the local bubble  a space of rarefied hot gas possibly produced by the supernova remnant geminga   or multiple supernovae in subgroup of the pleiades moving group  the distance between the local arm and the next arm out the perseus arm  is about  light-years  the sun and thus the solar system is found in what scientists call the galactic habitable zone 
the  or the solar apex  is the direction that the sun travels relative to other nearby stars this motion is towards a point in the constellation hercules  near the star vega  stars within parsecs of the sun  light-years have speeds relative to the sun which can be modeled approximately by a maxwell-boltzmann distribution especially for the lower speeds or a log normal distribution especially for the higher speeds but with more high-speed stars greater than s than predicted by either distribution the mean velocity of these stars not the mean speed  relative to the sun or the mean velocity of the sun relative to them is around s  within  of the sun there are known stars in systems as of  including single stars it is estimated that a further systems within this range have not yet been identified out to  there may be up to  stars of which around  are known the number of substellar objects in that volume are expected to be comparable to the number of stars  of the nearest stellar systems within light-years from earth the closest being the red dwarf proxima centauri at approximately  light-years the sun ranks fourth in mass  the gaia catalogue of nearby stars  all within parsecs contains  stars and is thought to include at least  of the stars of stellar spectral type or earlier ie hotter  the sun orbits the center of the milky way and it is presently moving in the direction of the constellation of cygnus  a simple model of the motion of a star in the galaxy gives the galactic coordinates   and as where   and are the respective velocities with respect to the local standard of rest  and are the oort constants  is the angular velocity of galactic rotation for the local standard of rest is the epicyclic frequency and is the vertical oscillation frequency  for the sun the present values of   and are estimated as kms and estimates for the other constants are s kpc  skpc skpc and skpc we take and to be zero and is estimated to be parsecs  this model implies that the sun circulates around a point that is itself going around the galaxy the period of the sun circulation around the point is  which using the equivalence that a parsec equals s times  years comes to years shorter than the time it takes for the point to go around the galaxy in the   coordinates the sun describes an ellipse around the point whose length in the direction is and whose width in the direction is the ratio of length to width of this ellipse the same for all stars in our neighborhood is the moving point is presently at the oscillation in the direction takes the sun above the galactic plane and the same distance below it with a period of or years approximately  times per orbit  although is years the value of at the point around which the sun circulates is see oort constants  corresponding to years and this is the time that the point takes to go once around the galaxy other stars with the same value of have to take the same amount of time to go around the galaxy as the sun and thus remain in the same general vicinity as the sun the sun orbit around the milky way is perturbed due to the non-uniform mass distribution in milky way such as that in and between the galactic spiral arms it has been argued that the sun passage through the higher density spiral arms often coincides with mass extinctions on earth perhaps due to increased impact events   it takes the solar system about years to complete one orbit through the milky way a galactic year   so it is thought to have completed orbits during the lifetime of the sun the orbital speed of the solar system about the center of the milky way is approximately s s  at this speed it takes around  years for the solar system to travel a distance of light-year or days to travel   the milky way is moving with respect to the cosmic microwave background radiation cmb in the direction of the constellation hydra with a speed of s and the sun resultant velocity with respect to the cmb is about s in the direction of crater or leo   barycentre the sun is moved by the gravitational pull of the planets one can think of the barycentre of the solar system as being stationary or as moving in a steady motion around the galaxy the centre of the sun is always within  solar radii of the barycentre this motion of the sun is mainly due to jupiter saturn uranus and neptune for some periods of several decades the motion is rather regular forming a trefoil pattern whereas between these periods it appears more chaotic  after years nine times the synodic period of jupiter and saturn the pattern more or less repeats but rotated by about   the orbits of the inner planets including of the earth are similarly displaced by the same gravitational forces so the movement of the sun has little effect on the relative positions of the earth and the sun or on solar irradiance on the earth as a function of time  sdo stellar corona the temperature of the photosphere is approximately  whereas the temperature of the corona reaches   the high temperature of the corona shows that it is heated by something other than direct heat conduction from the photosphere  it is thought that the energy necessary to heat the corona is provided by turbulent motion in the convection zone below the photosphere and two main mechanisms have been proposed to explain coronal heating  the first is wave heating in which sound gravitational or magnetohydrodynamic waves are produced by turbulence in the convection zone  these waves travel upward and dissipate in the corona depositing their energy in the ambient matter in the form of heat  the other is magnetic heating in which magnetic energy is continuously built up by photospheric motion and released through magnetic reconnection in the form of large solar flares and myriad similar but smaller events nanoflares   currently it is unclear whether waves are an efficient heating mechanism all waves except alfvn waves have been found to dissipate or refract before reaching the corona  in addition alfvn waves do not easily dissipate in the corona current re focus has therefore shifted towards flare heating mechanisms  faint young sun paradox theoretical models of the sun development suggest that  to  years ago during the archean eon  the sun was only about  as bright as it is today such a weak star would not have been able to sustain liquid water on earth surface and thus life should not have been able to develop however the geological record demonstrates that earth has remained at a fairly constant temperature throughout its history and that the young earth was somewhat warmer than it is today one theory among scientists is that the atmosphere of the young earth contained much larger quantities of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide  methane  than are present today which trapped enough heat to compensate for the smaller amount of solar energy reaching it  however examination of archaean sediments appears inconsistent with the hypothesis of high greenhouse concentrations instead the moderate temperature range may be explained by a lower surface albedo brought about by less continental area and the lack of biologically induced cloud condensation nuclei this would have led to increased absorption of solar energy thereby compensating for the lower solar output  trundholm sun chariot nordic bronze age bc national museum of denmark the sun in culture the sun has been an object of veneration in many cultures throughout human history humanity most fundamental understanding of the sun is as the luminous disk in the sky whose presence above the horizon causes day and whose absence causes night in many prehistoric and ancient cultures the sun was thought to be a solar deity or other supernatural entity the sun has played an important part in many world religions as described in a later section in the early first millennium bc babylonian astronomers observed that the sun motion along the ecliptic is not uniform though they did not know why it is today known that this is due to the movement of earth in an elliptic orbit around the sun with earth moving faster when it is nearer to the sun at perihelion and moving slower when it is farther away at aphelion  one of the first people to offer a scientific or philosophical explanation for the sun was the greek philosopher anaxagoras  he reasoned that it was not the chariot of helios but instead a giant flaming ball of metal even larger than the land of the peloponnesus and that the moon reflected the light of the sun  for teaching this heresy  he was imprisoned by the authorities and sentenced to death  though he was later released through the intervention of pericles  eratosthenes estimated the distance between earth and the sun in the century bc as of stadia myriads and  the translation of which is ambiguous implying either  stadia  or  stadia  to kilometers or  to  au the latter value is correct to within a few percent in the century ad ptolemy estimated the distance as  times the radius of earth  approximately  kilometers   the theory that the sun is the center around which the planets orbit was first proposed by the ancient greek aristarchus of samos in the century bc and later adopted by seleucus of seleucia see heliocentrism  this view was developed in a more detailed mathematical model of a heliocentric system in the century by nicolaus copernicus  observations of sunspots were recorded during the han dynasty  bcad  by chinese astronomers  who maintained records of these observations for centuries averroes also provided a description of sunspots in the century  the invention of the telescope in the early century permitted detailed observations of sunspots by thomas harriot  galileo galilei and other astronomers galileo posited that sunspots were on the surface of the sun rather than small objects passing between earth and the sun  arabic astronomical contributions include al-battani discovery that the direction of the sun apogee the place in the sun orbit against the fixed stars where it seems to be moving slowest is changing  in modern heliocentric terms this is caused by a gradual motion of the aphelion of the orbit ibn yunus observed more than  entries for the sun position for many years using a large astrolabe   guido bonatti from an observation of a transit of venus in  the persian astronomer and polymath ibn sina concluded that venus is closer to earth than the sun  in giovanni cassini and jean richer determined the distance to mars and were thereby able to calculate the distance to the sun in  isaac newton observed the sun light using a prism  and showed that it is made up of light of many colors  in  william herschel discovered infrared radiation beyond the red part of the solar spectrum  the century saw advancement in spectroscopic studies of the sun joseph von fraunhofer recorded more than absorption lines in the spectrum the strongest of which are still often referred to as fraunhofer lines  in the early years of the modern scientific era the source of the sun energy was a significant puzzle lord kelvin suggested that the sun is a gradually cooling liquid body that is radiating an internal store of heat  kelvin and hermann von helmholtz then proposed a gravitational contraction mechanism to explain the energy output but the resulting age estimate was only years well short of the time span of at least years suggested by some geological discoveries of that time   in joseph lockyer  who discovered helium in the solar spectrum proposed a meteoritic hypothesis for the formation and evolution of the sun  not until was a documented solution offered ernest rutherford suggested that the sun output could be maintained by an internal source of heat and suggested radioactive decay as the source  however it would be albert einstein who would provide the essential clue to the source of the sun energy output with his massenergy equivalence relation   in  sir arthur eddington proposed that the pressures and temperatures at the core of the sun could produce a nuclear fusion reaction that merged hydrogen protons into helium nuclei resulting in a production of energy from the net change in mass  the preponderance of hydrogen in the sun was confirmed in by cecilia payne using the ionization theory developed by meghnad saha  the theoretical concept of fusion was developed in the by the astrophysicists subrahmanyan chandrasekhar and hans bethe  hans bethe calculated the details of the two main energy-producing nuclear reactions that power the sun   in  margaret burbidge  geoffrey burbidge  william fowler and fred hoyle showed that most of the elements in the universe have been synthesized by nuclear reactions inside stars some like the sun  solar observatory geomagnetic storm  the first satellites designed for long term observation of the sun from interplanetary space were nasa pioneers   and  which were launched between and  these probes orbited the sun at a distance similar to that of earth and made the first detailed measurements of the solar wind and the solar magnetic field pioneer operated for a particularly long time transmitting data until may    in the  two helios spacecraft and the skylab apollo telescope mount provided scientists with significant new data on solar wind and the solar corona the helios and probes were usgerman collaborations that studied the solar wind from an orbit carrying the spacecraft inside mercury orbit at perihelion  the skylab space station launched by nasa in  included a solar observatory module called the apollo telescope mount that was operated by astronauts resident on the station  skylab made the first time-resolved observations of the solar transition region and of ultraviolet emissions from the solar corona  discoveries included the first observations of coronal mass ejections then called coronal transients and of coronal holes  now known to be intimately associated with the solar wind  question mark in  the solar maximum mission was launched by nasa this spacecraft was designed to observe gamma rays x-rays and uv radiation from solar flares during a time of high solar activity and solar luminosity  just a few months after launch however an electronics failure caused the probe to go into standby mode and it spent the next three years in this inactive state in space shuttle mission sts- retrieved the satellite and repaired its electronics before re-releasing it into orbit the solar maximum mission subsequently acquired thousands of images of the solar corona before re-entering earth atmosphere in june   launched in  japan yohkoh   satellite observed solar flares at x-ray wavelengths mission data allowed scientists to identify several different types of flares and demonstrated that the corona away from regions of peak activity was much more dynamic and active than had previously been supposed yohkoh observed an entire solar cycle but went into standby mode when an annular eclipse in caused it to lose its lock on the sun it was destroyed by atmospheric re-entry in   one of the most important solar missions to date has been the solar and heliospheric observatory  jointly built by the european space agency and nasa and launched on december   originally intended to serve a two-year mission a mission extension through was approved in october   it has proven so useful that a follow-on mission the solar dynamics observatory sdo was launched in february   situated at the lagrangian point between earth and the sun at which the gravitational pull from both is equal soho has provided a constant view of the sun at many wavelengths since its launch  besides its direct solar observation soho has enabled the discovery of a large number of comets  mostly tiny sungrazing comets that incinerate as they pass the sun  all these satellites have observed the sun from the plane of the ecliptic and so have only observed its equatorial regions in detail the probe was launched in to study the sun polar regions it first traveled to jupiter to slingshot into an orbit that would take it far above the plane of the ecliptic once was in its scheduled orbit it began observing the solar wind and magnetic field strength at high solar latitudes finding that the solar wind from high latitudes was moving at about s which was slower than expected and that there were large magnetic waves emerging from high latitudes that scattered galactic cosmic rays  elemental abundances in the photosphere are well known from spectroscopic studies but the composition of the interior of the sun is more poorly understood a solar wind sample return mission genesis  was designed to allow astronomers to directly measure the composition of solar material  the solar terrestrial relations observatory stereo mission was launched in october  two identical spacecraft were launched into orbits that cause them to respectively pull further ahead of and fall gradually behind earth this enables stereoscopic imaging of the sun and solar phenomena such as coronal mass ejections   the parker solar probe was launched in aboard a delta iv heavy rocket and will reach a perigee of in  making it the closest-orbiting manmade satellite as the first spacecraft to fly low into the solar corona  the indian space re organisation has scheduled the launch of a satellite named aditya for mid  its main instrument will be a coronagraph for studying the dynamics of the solar corona  sunset mojave desert international space station the brightness of the sun can cause pain from looking at it with the naked eye  however ng so for brief periods is not hazardous for normal non-dilated eyes   looking directly at the sun causes phosphene visual artifacts and temporary partial blindness it also delivers about of sunlight to the retina slightly heating it and potentially causing damage in eyes that cannot respond properly to the brightness   uv exposure gradually yellows the lens of the eye over a period of years and is thought to contribute to the formation of cataracts  but this depends on general exposure to solar uv and not whether one looks directly at the sun  long-duration viewing of the direct sun with the naked eye can begin to cause uv-induced sunburn-like lesions on the retina after about seconds particularly under conditions where the uv light from the sun is intense and well focused   conditions are worsened by young eyes or new lens implants which admit more uv than aging natural eyes sun angles near the zenith and observing locations at high altitude viewing the sun through light-concentrating optics such as binoculars may result in permanent damage to the retina without an appropriate filter that blocks uv and substantially dims the sunlight when using an attenuating filter to view the sun the viewer is cautioned to use a filter specifically designed for that use some improvised filters that pass uv or ir rays can actually harm the eye at high brightness levels  herschel wedges  also called solar diagonals are effective and inexpensive for small telescopes the sunlight that is destined for the eyepiece is reflected from an unsilvered surface of a piece of glass only a very small fraction of the incident light is reflected the rest passes through the glass and leaves the instrument if the glass breaks because of the heat no light at all is reflected making the device fail-safe simple filters made of darkened glass allow the full intensity of sunlight to pass through if they break endangering the observer eyesight unfiltered binoculars can deliver hundreds of times as much energy as using the naked eye possibly causing immediate damage it is claimed that even brief glances at the midday sun through an unfiltered telescope can cause permanent damage  halo sun dogs partial solar eclipses are hazardous to view because the eye pupil is not adapted to the unusually high visual contrast the pupil dilates according to the total amount of light in the field of view by the brightest object in the field during partial eclipses most sunlight is blocked by the moon passing in front of the sun but the uncovered parts of the photosphere have the same surface brightness as during a normal day in the overall gloom the pupil expands from  to  and each retinal cell exposed to the solar image receives up to ten times more light than it would looking at the non-eclipsed sun this can damage or kill those cells resulting in small permanent blind spots for the viewer  the hazard is insidious for inexperienced observers and for children because there is no perception of pain it is not immediately obvious that one vision is being destroyed during sunrise and sunset sunlight is attenuated because of rayleigh scattering and mie scattering from a particularly long passage through earth atmosphere  and the sun is sometimes faint enough to be viewed comfortably with the naked eye or safely with optics provided there is no risk of bright sunlight suddenly appearing through a break between clouds hazy conditions atmospheric dust and high humidity contribute to this atmospheric attenuation  an optical phenomenon  known as a green flash  can sometimes be seen shortly after sunset or before sunrise the flash is caused by light from the sun just below the horizon being bent usually through a temperature inversion  towards the observer light of shorter wavelengths violet blue green is bent more than that of longer wavelengths yellow orange red but the violet and blue light is scattered more leaving light that is perceived as green  ultraviolet light from the sun has antiseptic properties and can be used to sanitize tools and water it also causes sunburn  and has other biological effects such as the production of vitamin d and sun tanning  it is also the main cause of skin cancer  ultraviolet light is strongly attenuated by earth ozone layer  so that the amount of uv varies greatly with latitude and has been partially responsible for many biological adaptations including variations in human skin color in different regions of the earth  solar system the sun has eight known planets this includes four terrestrial planets  mercury  venus  earth  and mars  two gas giants  jupiter and saturn  and two ice giants  uranus and neptune  the solar system also has at least five dwarf planets  an asteroid belt  numerous comets  and a large number of icy bodies which lie beyond the orbit of neptune solar deity worship of the sun was central to civilizations such as the ancient egyptians  the inca of south america and the aztecs of what is now mexico  in religions such as hinduism  the sun is still considered a god many ancient monuments were constructed with solar phenomena in mind for example stone megaliths accurately mark the summer or winter solstice some of the most prominent megaliths are located in nabta playa  egypt  mnajdra  malta and at stonehenge  england  newgrange  a prehistoric human-built mount in ireland  was designed to detect the winter solstice the pyramid of el castillo at chichn itz in mexico is designed to cast shadows in the shape of serpents climbing the pyramid at the vernal and autumnal equinoxes  the egyptians portrayed the god ra as being carried across the sky in a solar barque accompanied by lesser gods and to the greeks he was helios carried by a chariot drawn by fiery horses from the reign of elagabalus in the late roman empire the sun birthday was a holiday celebrated as sol invictus literally unconquered sun soon after the winter solstice which may have been an antecedent to christmas regarding the fixed stars  the sun appears from earth to revolve once a year along the ecliptic through the zodiac  and so greek astronomers categorized it as one of the seven planets greek  wanderer the naming of the days of the weeks after the seven planets dates to the roman era     solar deities play a major role in many world religions and mythologies  the ancient sumerians believed that the sun was utu    the god of justice and twin brother of inanna  the queen of heaven   who was identified as the planet venus  later utu was identified with the east semitic god shamash    utu was regarded as a helper-deity who aided those in distress  and in iconography  he is usually portrayed with a long beard and clutching a saw  which represented his role as the dispenser of justice  from at least the fourth dynasty of ancient egypt the sun was worshipped as the god ra  portrayed as a falcon-headed divinity surmounted by the solar disk and surrounded by a serpent in the new empire period the sun became identified with the dung beetle  whose spherical ball of dung was identified with the sun in the form of the sun disc aten  the sun had a brief resurgence during the amarna period when it again became the preeminent if not only divinity for the pharaoh akhenaton    in proto-indo-european religion  the sun was personified as the goddess    derivatives of this goddess in indo-european languages include the old norse sl  sanskrit surya  gaulish sulis  lithuanian saul  and slavic   in ancient greek religion  the sun deity was the male god helios  but traces of an earlier female solar deity are preserved in helen of troy   in later times helios was syncretized with apollo   in the bible  malachi  mentions the sun of righteousness sometimes translated as the sun of justice  which some christians have interpreted as a reference to the messiah  christ   in ancient roman culture sunday was the day of the sun god it was adopted as the sabbath day by christians who did not have a jewish background the symbol of light was a pagan device adopted by christians and perhaps the most important one that did not come from jewish traditions in paganism the sun was a source of life giving warmth and illumination to mankind it was the center of a popular cult among romans who would stand at dawn to catch the first rays of sunshine as they prayed the celebration of the winter solstice which influenced christmas was part of the roman cult of the unconquered sun  sol invictus  christian churches were built with an orientation so that the congregation faced toward the sunrise in the east  tonatiuh  the aztec god of the sun was usually depicted holding arrows and a shield  and was closely associated with the practice of human sacrifice   the sun goddess amaterasu is the most important deity in the shinto religion   and she is believed to be the direct ancestor of all japanese emperors   advanced composition explorer antisolar point list of brightest stars sun path sun-earth day sungazing timeline of

 ishtar terra right-hand rule venus is the second planet from the sun  it is named after the roman goddess of love and beauty  as the brightest natural object in earth night sky after the moon  venus can cast shadows and can be on rare occasions visible to the naked eye in broad daylight   venus lies within earth orbit  and so never appears to venture far from the sun either setting in the west just after dusk or rising in the east a little while before dawn venus orbits the sun every  earth days  it has a synodic day length of earth days and a sidereal rotation period of earth days as a consequence it takes longer to rotate about its axis than any other planet in the solar system  and does so in the opposite direction to all but uranus  this means the sun rises in the west and sets in the east  venus does not have any moons  a distinction it shares only with mercury among the planets in the solar system  venus is a terrestrial planet and is sometimes called earth sister planet because of their similar size mass proximity to the sun and bulk composition it is radically different from earth in other respects it has the densest atmosphere of the four terrestrial planets consisting of more than  carbon dioxide  the atmospheric pressure at the planet surface is about times the sea level pressure of earth or roughly the pressure at  underwater on earth even though mercury is closer to the sun venus has the hottest surface of any planet in the solar system with a mean temperature of   venus is shrouded by an opaque layer of highly reflective clouds of sulfuric acid  preventing its surface from being seen from space in visible light  it may have had water oceans in the past   but these would have vaporized as the temperature rose due to a runaway greenhouse effect   the water has probably photodissociated  and the free hydrogen has been swept into interplanetary space by the solar wind because of the lack of a planetary magnetic field   as one of the brightest objects in the sky venus has been a major fixture in human culture for as long as records have existed it has been made sacred to gods of many cultures and has been a prime inspiration for writers and poets as the morning star and evening star venus was the first planet to have its motions plotted across the sky as early as the second millennium bc  due to its proximity to earth venus has been a prime target for early interplanetary exploration it was the first planet beyond earth visited by a spacecraft  mariner in  and the first to be successfully landed on by venera in  venus thick clouds render observation of its surface impossible in visible light and the first detailed maps did not emerge until the arrival of the magellan orbiter in  plans have been proposed for rovers or more complex missions but they are hindered by venus hostile surface conditions the possibility of life on venus has long been a topic of speculation and in recent years has received active re contents earth venus is one of the four terrestrial planets in the solar system meaning that it is a rocky body like earth it is similar to earth in size and mass and is often described as earth sister or twin  the diameter of venus is  only   less than earth its mass is  of earth conditions on the venusian surface differ radically from those on earth because its dense atmosphere is  carbon dioxide with most of the remaining  being nitrogen   the surface pressure is  megapascals  and the surface temperature is   above the critical points of both major constituents and making the surface atmosphere a supercritical fluid  venusian atmosphere ultraviolet akatsuki atmosphere of venus venus has an extremely dense atmosphere composed of  carbon dioxide   nitrogen both exist as supercritical fluids at the planet surfaceand traces of other gases including sulfur dioxide   the mass of its atmosphere is times that of earth whereas the pressure at its surface is about times that at earth pressure equivalent to that at a depth of nearly  mi under earth oceans the density at the surface is kgm   that of water or times as dense as earth atmosphere at   at sea level the -rich atmosphere generates the strongest greenhouse effect in the solar system creating surface temperatures of at least     this makes venus surface hotter than mercury  which has a minimum surface temperature of   and maximum surface temperature of     even though venus is nearly twice mercury distance from the sun and thus receives only  of mercury solar irradiance  venus atmosphere is extremely rich in primordial noble gases compared to that of earth  this enrichment indicates an early divergence from earth in evolution an unusually large comet impact  or accretion of a more massive primary atmosphere from solar nebula  have been proposed to explain the enrichment however the atmosphere is also depleted of radiogenic argon a proxy to mantle degassing suggesting an early shutdown of major magmatism   studies have suggested that billions of years ago venus atmosphere could have been much more like the one surrounding the early earth and that there may have been substantial quantities of liquid water on the surface after a period of million to several billion years  solar forcing from rising luminosity of the sun caused the evaporation of the original water a runaway greenhouse effect was created once a critical level of greenhouse gases including water was added to its atmosphere  although the surface conditions on venus are no longer hospitable to any earth-like life that may have formed before this event there is speculation on the possibility that life exists in the upper cloud layers of venus  up from the surface where the temperature ranges between and  and  and  but the environment is acidic    the putative detection of phosphine in venus atmosphere with no known pathway for abiotic production led to speculation in september that there could be extant life currently present in the atmosphere   later re not yet peer reviewed attributed the spectroscopic signal that was interpreted as phosphine to sulfur dioxide   thermal inertia and the transfer of heat by winds in the lower atmosphere mean that the temperature of venus surface does not vary significantly between the planet two hemispheres those facing and not facing the sun despite venus extremely slow rotation winds at the surface are slow moving at a few kilometres per hour but because of the high density of the atmosphere at the surface they exert a significant amount of force against obstructions and transport dust and small stones across the surface this alone would make it difficult for a human to walk through even without the heat pressure and lack of oxygen  above the dense layer are thick clouds consisting mainly of sulfuric acid  which is formed by sulfur dioxide and water through a chemical reaction resulting in sulfuric acid hydrate additionally the atmosphere consists of approximately  ferric chloride    other possible constituents of the cloud particles are ferric sulfate  aluminium chloride and phosphoric anhydride  clouds at different levels have different compositions and particle size distributions  these clouds reflect and scatter about  of the sunlight that falls on them back into space and prevent visual observation of venus surface the permanent cloud cover means that although venus is closer than earth to the sun it receives less sunlight on the ground strong h  winds at the cloud tops go around venus about every four to five earth days  winds on venus move at up to times the speed of its rotation whereas earth fastest winds are only  rotation speed  the surface of venus is effectively isothermal  it retains a constant temperature not only between the two hemispheres but between the equator and the poles   venus minute axial tilt less than  compared to on earthalso minimises seasonal temperature variation  altitude is one of the few factors that affect venusian temperature the highest point on venus maxwell montes  is therefore the coolest point on venus with a temperature of about   and an atmospheric pressure of about     in  the spacecraft imaged a highly reflective substance at the tops of the highest mountain peaks that bore a strong resemblance to terrestrial snow this substance likely formed from a similar process to snow albeit at a far higher temperature too volatile to condense on the surface it rose in gaseous form to higher elevations where it is cooler and could precipitate the identity of this substance is not known with certainty but speculation has ranged from elemental tellurium to lead sulfide  galena   although venus has no seasons as such in astronomers identified a cyclical variation in sunlight absorption by the atmosphere possibly caused by opaque absorbing particles suspended in the upper clouds the variation causes observed changes in the speed of venus zonal winds and appears to rise and fall in time with the sun -year sunspot cycle   the existence of lightning in the atmosphere of venus has been controversial  since the first suspected bursts were detected by the soviet venera probes    in  venus express clearly detected whistler mode waves  the signatures of lightning their intermittent appearance indicates a pattern associated with weather activity according to these measurements the lightning rate is at least half of that on earth  however other instruments have not detected lightning at all  the origin of any lightning remains unclear but could originate from the clouds or volcanoes in  discovered that a huge double atmospheric vortex exists at the south pole   also discovered in  that an ozone layer exists high in the atmosphere of venus  on january  esa scientists reported that the ionosphere of venus streams outwards in a manner similar to the ion tail seen streaming from a comet under similar conditions   in december  and to a lesser extent in april and may  reers working on japan mission observed bow shapes in the atmosphere of venus this was considered direct evidence of the existence of perhaps the largest stationary gravity waves in the solar system    earth atmosphere atmosphere of venus hitran   wavenumber wavelengths mapping of venus geology of venus venera the venusian surface was a subject of speculation until some of its secrets were revealed by planetary science in the century venera landers in and returned images of a surface covered in sediment and relatively angular rocks  the surface was mapped in detail by in  the ground shows evidence of extensive volcanism  and the sulfur in the atmosphere may indicate that there have been recent eruptions   about  of the venusian surface is covered by smooth volcanic plains consisting of  plains with wrinkle ridges and  smooth or lobate plains  two highland continents make up the rest of its surface area one lying in the planet northern hemisphere and the other just south of the equator the northern continent is called ishtar terra after ishtar  the babylonian goddess of love and is about the size of australia maxwell montes  the highest mountain on venus lies on ishtar terra its peak is  above the venusian average surface elevation  the southern continent is called aphrodite terra  after the greek goddess of love and is the larger of the two highland regions at roughly the size of south america a network of fractures and faults covers much of this area  the absence of evidence of lava flow accompanying any of the visible calderas remains an enigma the planet has few impact craters  demonstrating that the surface is relatively young at million years old   venus has some unique surface features in addition to the impact craters mountains and valleys commonly found on rocky planets among these are flat-topped volcanic features called  farra  which look somewhat like pancakes and range in size from to  to  across and from to   to  high radial star-like fracture systems called novae features with both radial and concentric fractures resembling spider webs known as  arachnoids  and coronae circular rings of fractures sometimes surrounded by a depression these features are volcanic in origin  most venusian surface features are named after historical and mythological women  exceptions are maxwell montes named after james clerk maxwell  and highland regions alpha regio  beta regio  and ovda regio  the last three features were named before the current system was adopted by the international astronomical union  the body which oversees planetary nomenclature   the longitude of physical features on venus are expressed relative to its prime meridian  the original prime meridian passed through the radar-bright spot at the centre of the oval feature eve located south of alpha regio  after the venera missions were completed the prime meridian was redefined to pass through the central peak in the crater ariadne on sedna planitia    the stratigraphically oldest tessera terrains have consistently lower thermal emissivity than the surrounding basaltic plains measured by venus express and  indicating a different possibly a more felsic  mineral assemblage   the mechanism to generate a large amount of felsic crust usually requires the presence of water ocean and plate tectonics  implying that habitable condition had existed on early venus however the nature of tessera terrains is far from certain  volcanology of venus maat mons much of the venusian surface appears to have been shaped by volcanic activity venus has several times as many volcanoes as earth and it has large volcanoes that are over  across the only volcanic complex of this size on earth is the big island of hawaii  this is not because venus is more volcanically active than earth but because its crust is older and is not subject the same erosion process earth oceanic crust is continually recycled by subduction at the boundaries of tectonic plates  and has an average age of about a hundred million years  whereas the venusian surface is estimated to be million years old   several lines of evidence point to ongoing volcanic activity on venus sulfur dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere dropped by a factor of between and  ed in  and again declined -fold  this may mean that levels had been boosted several times by large volcanic eruptions   it has also been suggested that venusian lightning discussed below could originate from volcanic activity ie volcanic lightning  in january  astronomers reported evidence that suggests that venus is currently volcanically active  specifically the detection of olivine  a volcanic product that would weather quickly on the planet surface   in and  the first direct evidence for ongoing volcanism was observed by  in the form of four transient localized infrared hot spots within the rift zone ganis chasma   n  near the shield volcano maat mons  three of the spots were observed in more than one successive orbit these spots are thought to represent lava freshly released by volcanic eruptions   the actual temperatures are not known because the size of the hot spots could not be measured but are likely to have been in the    range relative to a normal temperature of    impact craters almost a thousand impact craters on venus are evenly distributed across its surface on other cratered bodies such as earth and the moon craters show a range of states of degradation on the moon degradation is caused by subsequent impacts whereas on earth it is caused by wind and rain erosion on venus about  of the craters are in pristine condition the number of craters together with their well-preserved condition indicates the planet underwent a global resurfacing event million years ago   followed by a decay in volcanism  whereas earth crust is in continuous motion venus is thought to be unable to sustain such a process without plate tectonics to dissipate heat from its mantle venus instead undergoes a cyclical process in which mantle temperatures rise until they reach a critical level that weakens the crust then over a period of about million years subduction occurs on an enormous scale completely recycling the crust  venusian craters range from to  to  in diameter no craters are smaller than km because of the effects of the dense atmosphere on incoming objects objects with less than a certain kinetic energy are slowed so much by the atmosphere that they do not create an impact crater  incoming projectiles less than  in diameter will fragment and burn up in the atmosphere before reaching the ground  differentiated without seismic data or knowledge of its moment of inertia  little direct information is available about the internal structure and geochemistry of venus  the similarity in size and density between venus and earth suggests they share a similar internal structure a core  mantle  and crust  like that of earth the venusian core is most likely at least partially liquid because the two planets have been cooling at about the same rate  although a completely solid core cannot be ruled out  the slightly smaller size of venus means pressures are  lower in its deep interior than earth  the predicted values for the moment of inertia based on planetary models suggest a core radius of   this is in line with the first observation-based estimate of   the principal difference between the two planets is the lack of evidence for plate tectonics on venus possibly because its crust is too strong to subduct without water to make it less viscous  this results in reduced heat loss from the planet preventing it from cooling and providing a likely explanation for its lack of an internally generated magnetic field   instead venus may lose its internal heat in periodic major resurfacing events  in  venera found venus magnetic field to be much weaker than that of earth this magnetic field is induced by an interaction between the ionosphere and the solar wind    rather than by an internal dynamo as in the earth core  venus small induced magnetosphere provides negligible protection to the atmosphere against cosmic radiation  the lack of an intrinsic magnetic field at venus was surprising given that it is similar to earth in size and was expected also to contain a dynamo at its core a dynamo requires three things a conducting liquid rotation and convection  the core is thought to be electrically conductive and although its rotation is often thought to be too slow simulations show it is adequate to produce a dynamo   this implies that the dynamo is missing because of a lack of convection in venus core on earth convection occurs in the liquid outer layer of the core because the bottom of the liquid layer is much higher in temperature than the top on venus a global resurfacing event may have shut down plate tectonics and led to a reduced heat flux through the crust this insulating effect would cause the mantle temperature to increase thereby reducing the heat flux out of the core as a result no internal geodynamo is available to drive a magnetic field instead the heat from the core is reheating the crust  one possibility is that venus has no solid inner core  or that its core is not cooling so that the entire liquid part of the core is at approximately the same temperature another possibility is that its core has already completely solidified the state of the core is highly dependent on the concentration of sulfur  which is unknown at present  the weak magnetosphere around venus means that the solar wind is interacting directly with its outer atmosphere here ions of hydrogen and oxygen are being created by the dissociation of water molecules from ultraviolet radiation the solar wind then supplies energy that gives some of these ions sufficient velocity to escape venus gravity field this erosion process results in a steady loss of low-mass hydrogen helium and oxygen ions whereas higher-mass molecules such as carbon dioxide are more likely to be retained atmospheric erosion by the solar wind could have led to the loss of most of venus water during the first billion years after it formed  however the planet may have retained a dynamo for its first billion years so the water loss may have occurred more recently  the erosion has increased the ratio of higher-mass deuterium to lower-mass hydrogen in the atmosphere times compared to the rest of the solar system  orbit of venus venus orbits the sun at an average distance of about  au  km  mi  and completes an orbit every  days although all planetary orbits are elliptical  venus orbit is currently the closest to circular  with an eccentricity of less than   simulations of the early solar system orbital dynamics have shown that the eccentricity of the venus orbit may have been substantially larger in the past reaching values as high as  and possibly impacting the early climate evolution  the current near-circular orbit of venus means that when venus lies between earth and the sun in inferior conjunction  it makes the closest approach to earth of any planet at an average distance of   n   the planet reaches inferior conjunction every days on average  because of the decreasing eccentricity of earth orbit  the minimum distances will become greater over tens of thousands of years from the year to  there are approaches less than million km then there are none for about  years  all the planets in the solar system orbit the sun in an anticlockwise direction as viewed from above earth north pole most planets also rotate on their axes in an anti-clockwise direction but venus rotates clockwise in retrograde rotation once every earth daysthe slowest rotation of any planet because its rotation is so slow venus is very close to spherical  a venusian sidereal day thus lasts longer than a venusian year  versus  earth days venus equator rotates at h  whereas earth rotates at h    venus rotation period measured with spacecraft data over a -day period is smaller than the rotation period measured during the -year period between the magellan spacecraft and visits with a difference of about  minutes  because of the retrograde rotation the length of a solar day on venus is significantly shorter than the sidereal day at  earth days making the venusian solar day shorter than mercury earth days  one venusian year is about  venusian solar days  to an observer on the surface of venus the sun would rise in the west and set in the east  although venus opaque clouds prevent observing the sun from the planet surface  venus may have formed from the solar nebula with a different rotation period and obliquity reaching its current state because of chaotic spin changes caused by planetary perturbations and tidal effects on its dense atmosphere a change that would have occurred over the course of billions of years the rotation period of venus may represent an equilibrium state between tidal locking to the sun gravitation which tends to slow rotation and an atmospheric tide created by solar heating of the thick venusian atmosphere   the -day average interval between successive close approaches to earth is almost exactly equal to venusian solar days  to be precise  but the hypothesis of a spin-orbit resonance with earth has been discounted  venus has no natural satellites  it has several trojan asteroids  the quasi-satellite ve   and two other temporary trojans ck and xe   in the century giovanni cassini reported a moon orbiting venus which was named neith and numerous sightings were reported over the following  but most were determined to be stars in the vicinity alex alemi and david stevenson study of models of the early solar system at the california institute of technology shows venus likely had at least one moon created by a huge impact event billions of years ago  about million years later according to the study another impact reversed the planet spin direction and caused the venusian moon gradually to spiral inward until it collided with venus  if later impacts created moons these were removed in the same way an alternative explanation for the lack of satellites is the effect of strong solar tides which can destabilize large satellites orbiting the inner terrestrial planets  to the naked eye  venus appears as a white point of light brighter than any other planet or star apart from the sun  the planet mean apparent magnitude is  with a standard deviation of   the brightest magnitude occurs during crescent phase about one month before or after inferior conjunction venus fades to about magnitude when it is backlit by the sun  the planet is bright enough to be seen in broad daylight  but is more easily visible when the sun is low on the horizon or setting as an inferior planet  it always lies within about of the sun   venus overtakes earth every days as it orbits the sun  as it does so it changes from the evening star visible after sunset to the morning star visible before sunrise although mercury  the other inferior planet reaches a maximum elongation of only and is often difficult to discern in twilight venus is hard to miss when it is at its brightest its greater maximum elongation means it is visible in dark skies long after sunset as the brightest point-like object in the sky venus is a commonly misreported  unidentified flying object   phases of venus as it orbits the sun venus displays phases like those of the moon in a telescopic view the planet appears as a small and full disc when it is on the opposite side of the sun at superior conjunction  venus shows a larger disc and quarter phase at its maximum elongations from the sun and appears its brightest in the night sky the planet presents a much larger thin crescent in telescopic views as it passes along the near side between earth and the sun venus displays its largest size and new phase when it is between earth and the sun at inferior conjunction its atmosphere is visible through telescopes by the halo of sunlight refracted around it  transit of venus transit of venus transit of venus the venusian orbit is slightly inclined relative to earth orbit thus when the planet passes between earth and the sun it usually does not cross the face of the sun transits of venus occur when the planet inferior conjunction coincides with its presence in the plane of earth orbit transits of venus occur in cycles of with the current pattern of transits being pairs of transits separated by eight years at intervals of about or a pattern first discovered in by the english astronomer jeremiah horrocks   the latest pair was june  and june   the transit could be watched live from many online outlets or observed locally with the right equipment and conditions  the preceding pair of transits occurred in december and december  the following pair will occur in december and december   the transit is the subject of the oldest film known the passage de venus  historically transits of venus were important because they allowed astronomers to determine the size of the astronomical unit  and hence the size of the solar system as shown by horrocks in   captain cook exploration of the east coast of australia came after he had sailed to tahiti in to observe a transit of venus   the pentagram of venus is the path that venus makes as observed from earth  successive inferior conjunctions of venus repeat very near a  ratio earth orbits eight times for every orbits of venus shifting upon sequential inferior conjunctions the  ratio is approximate  is approximately  while venus orbits the sun in  years  naked eye observations of venus during daylight hours exist in several anecdotes and records astronomer edmund halley calculated its maximum naked eye brightness in  when many londoners were alarmed by its appearance in the daytime french emperor napoleon bonaparte once witnessed a daytime apparition of the planet while at a reception in luxembourg   another historical daytime observation of the planet took place during the inauguration of the american president abraham lincoln in washington dc  on march   although naked eye visibility of venus phases is disputed records exist of observations of its crescent  a long-standing mystery of venus observations is the so-called ashen light an apparent weak illumination of its dark side seen when the planet is in the crescent phase the first claimed observation of ashen light was made in  but the existence of the illumination has never been reliably confirmed observers have speculated it may result from electrical activity in the venusian atmosphere but it could be illusory resulting from the physiological effect of observing a bright crescent-shaped object   observations and explorations of venus black drop effect because the movements of venus appear to be discontinuous it disappears due to its proximity to the sun for many days at a time and then reappears on the other horizon some cultures did not recognize venus as a single entity  instead they assumed it to be two separate stars on each horizon the morning and evening star  nonetheless a cylinder seal from the jemdet nasr period and the venus tablet of ammisaduqa from the first babylonian dynasty indicate that the ancient sumerians already knew that the morning and evening stars were the same celestial object    in the old babylonian period the planet venus was known as ninsi and later as dilbat  the name ninsi translates to divine lady illumination of heaven which refers to venus as the brightest visible star earlier spellings of the name were written with the cuneiform sign  su meaning to be red and the original meaning may have been divine lady of the redness of heaven in reference to the colour of the morning and evening sky  the chinese historically referred to the morning venus as the great white   or the opener starter of brightness   and the evening venus as the excellent west one    the ancient greeks also initially believed venus to be two separate stars phosphorus  the morning star and hesperus  the evening star pliny the elder credited the realization that they were a single object to pythagoras in the sixth century bc  while diogenes lartius argued that parmenides was probably responsible for this rediscovery  though they recognized venus as a single object the ancient romans continued to designate the morning aspect of venus as lucifer  literally light-bringer and the evening aspect as vesper   both of which are literal translations of their traditional greek names in the second century in his astronomical treatise almagest  ptolemy theorized that both mercury and venus are located between the sun and the earth the -century persian astronomer avicenna claimed to have observed the transit of venus   which later astronomers took as confirmation of ptolemy theory  in the century the andalusian astronomer ibn bajjah observed two planets as black spots on the face of the sun these were thought to be the transits of venus and mercury by -century maragha astronomer qotb al-din shirazi  though this cannot be true as there were no venus transits in ibn bajjah lifetime  n  galileo sun earth when the italian physicist galileo galilei first observed the planet in the early century he found it showed phases like the moon varying from crescent to gibbous to full and vice versa when venus is furthest from the sun in the sky it shows a half-lit phase  and when it is closest to the sun in the sky it shows as a crescent or full phase this could be possible only if venus orbited the sun and this was among the first observations to clearly contradict the ptolemaic geocentric model that the solar system was concentric and centred on earth   the transit of venus was accurately predicted by jeremiah horrocks and observed by him and his friend william crabtree  at each of their respective homes on december  november under the julian calendar in use at that time  the atmosphere of venus was discovered in by russian polymath mikhail lomonosov    venus atmosphere was observed in by german astronomer johann schrter  schrter found when the planet was a thin crescent the cusps extended through more than  he correctly surmised this was due to scattering of sunlight in a dense atmosphere later american astronomer chester smith lyman observed a complete ring around the dark side of the planet when it was at inferior conjunction  providing further evidence for an atmosphere  the atmosphere complicated efforts to determine a rotation period for the planet and observers such as italian-born astronomer giovanni cassini and schrter incorrectly estimated periods of about from the motions of markings on the planet apparent surface  little more was discovered about venus until the century its almost featureless disc gave no hint what its surface might be like and it was only with the development of spectroscopic  radar and ultraviolet observations that more of its secrets were revealed the first ultraviolet observations were carried out in the  when frank e ross found that ultraviolet photographs revealed considerable detail that was absent in visible and infrared radiation he suggested this was due to a dense yellow lower atmosphere with high cirrus clouds above it  spectroscopic observations in the gave the first clues about the venusian rotation vesto slipher tried to measure the doppler shift of light from venus but found he could not detect any rotation he surmised the planet must have a much longer rotation period than had previously been thought  later work in the showed the rotation was retrograde radar observations of venus were first carried out in the  and provided the first measurements of the rotation period which were close to the modern value  radar observations in the revealed details of the venusian surface for the first time pulses of radio waves were beamed at the planet using the  radio telescope at arecibo observatory  and the echoes revealed two highly reflective regions designated the alpha and beta regions the observations also revealed a bright region attributed to mountains which was called maxwell montes   these three features are now the only ones on venus that do not have female names  observations and explorations of venus the first robotic space probe mission to venus and any planet was venera of the soviet venera program launched in  though it lost contact en route  the first successful mission to venus as well as the world first successful interplanetary mission  was the mariner mission by the united states passing on december at   above the surface of venus and gathering data on the planet atmosphere   on october  the soviet venera successfully entered as the first to probe the atmosphere and deployed science experiments showed the surface temperature was hotter than had calculated at almost  determined that the atmosphere was  carbon dioxide   and discovered that venus atmosphere was considerably denser than designers had anticipated  the joint mariner data were analysed by a combined sovietamerican science team in a series of colloquia over the following year  in an early example of space cooperation  in  mariner swung by venus on its way to mercury and took ultraviolet photographs of the clouds revealing the extraordinarily high wind speeds in the venusian atmosphere mariner in  the soviet venera and landers transmitted the first images from the surface of venus which were in black and white in the first colour images of the surface were obtained with the soviet and landers nasa obtained additional data in with the pioneer venus project that consisted of two separate missions  pioneer venus orbiter and pioneer venus multiprobe   the successful soviet venera program came to a close in october  when venera and were placed in orbit to conduct detailed mapping of  of venus terrain from the north pole to latitude  several other venus flybys took place in the and that increased the understanding of venus including vega  vega  galileo  magellan  cassinihuygens  and messenger  then venus express by the european space agency esa entered orbit around venus in april  equipped with seven scientific instruments provided unprecedented long-term observation of venus atmosphere esa concluded the mission in december   as of  japan akatsuki is in a highly eccentric orbit around venus since december  and there are several probing proposals under study by roscosmos  nasa isro  esa and the private sector eg by rocketlab  venus in culture vincent van gogh the starry night   venus is a primary feature of the night sky and so has been of remarkable importance in mythology  astrology and fiction throughout history and in different cultures in sumerian religion  inanna was associated with the planet venus   several hymns praise inanna in her role as the goddess of the planet venus    theology professor jeffrey cooley has argued that in many myths inanna movements may correspond with the movements of the planet venus in the sky  the discontinuous movements of venus relate to both mythology as well as inanna dual nature  in  unlike any other deity inanna is able to descend into the netherworld and return to the heavens the planet venus appears to make a similar descent setting in the west and then rising again in the east  an introductory hymn describes inanna leaving the heavens and heading for  what could be presumed to be the mountains replicating the rising and setting of inanna to the west  in inanna and shukaletuda and inanna descent into the underworld appear to parallel the motion of the planet venus  in  shukaletuda is described as scanning the heavens in  of inanna possibly ing the eastern and western horizons  in the same myth while ing for her attacker inanna herself makes several movements that correspond with the movements of venus in the sky  classical poets such as homer  sappho  ovid and virgil spoke of the star and its light  poets such as william blake  robert frost  letitia elizabeth landon  alfred lord tennyson and william wordsworth wrote odes to it  in chinese the planet is called jn-xng  the golden planet of the metal element  in india shukra graha the planet shukra is named after the powerful saint shukra shukra which is used in indian vedic astrology  means clear pure or brightness clearness in sanskrit  one of the nine navagraha  it is held to affect wealth pleasure and reproduction it was the son of bhrgu  preceptor of the daityas and guru of the asuras  the word is also associated with semen or generation venus is known as kejora in indonesian and malaysian malay  modern chinese  japanese and korean cultures refer to the planet literally as the metal star   based on the five elements     the maya considered venus to be the most important celestial body after the sun and moon they called it   or  the great star  the cycles of venus were important to their calendar the ancient egyptians and greeks believed venus to be two separate bodies a morning star and an evening star the egyptians knew the morning star as tioumoutiri and the evening star as ouaiti  the greeks used the names phsphoros  meaning light-bringer whence the element phosphorus  alternately  meaning dawn-bringer for the morning star and hesperos  meaning western one for the evening star  though by the roman era they were recognized as one celestial object known as the star of venus  the traditional two greek names continued to be used though usually translated to latin as and    venus in fiction with the invention of the telescope the idea that venus was a physical world and possible destination began to take form the impenetrable venusian cloud cover gave science fiction writers free rein to speculate on conditions at its surface all the more so when early observations showed that not only was it similar in size to earth it possessed a substantial atmosphere closer to the sun than earth the planet was frequently depicted as warmer but still habitable by humans  the genre reached its peak between the and  at a time when science had revealed some aspects of venus but not yet the harsh reality of its surface conditions findings from the first missions to venus showed the reality to be quite different and brought this particular genre to an end  as scientific knowledge of venus advanced science fiction authors tried to keep pace particularly by conjecturing human attempts to terraform venus   venus symbol the astronomical symbol for venus is the same as that used in biology for the female sex a circle with a small cross beneath   the venus symbol also represents femininity  and in western alchemy stood for the metal copper   polished copper has been used for mirrors from antiquity and the symbol for venus has sometimes been understood to stand for the mirror of the goddess although that is not its true origin   life on venus speculation on the possibility of life on venus surface decreased significantly after the early when it became clear that the conditions are extreme compared to those on earth venus extreme temperature and atmospheric pressure make water-based life as currently known unlikely some scientists have speculated that thermoacidophilic extremophile microorganisms might exist in the cooler acidic upper layers of the venusian atmosphere    such speculations go back to  when carl sagan and harold j morowitz suggested in a nature article that tiny objects detected in venus clouds might be organisms similar to earth bacteria which are of approximately the same size carbon dioxide photosynthesis  in august  astronomers led by yeon joo lee reported that long-term pattern of absorbance and albedo changes in the atmosphere of the planet venus caused by unknown absorbers which may be chemicals or even large colonies of microorganisms high up in the atmosphere of the planet affect the climate  their light absorbance is almost identical to that of micro-organisms in earth clouds similar conclusions have been reached by other studies  in september  a team of astronomers led by jane greaves from cardiff university announced the likely detection of phosphine  a gas not known to be produced by any known chemical processes on the venusian surface or atmosphere in the upper levels of the planet clouds      one proposed source for this phosphine is living organisms  the phosphine was detected at heights of at least miles above the surface and primarily at mid-latitudes with none detected at the poles the discovery prompted nasa administrator jim bridenstine to publicly call for a new focus on the study of venus describing the phosphine find as the most significant development yet in building the case for life off earth   a statement was published on october   by the organizing committee of the international astronomical union commission on astrobiology in which the authors of the september paper about phosphine were accused of unethical behavior and criticized for being unscientific and misleading the public   members of that commission have since distanced themselves from the iau statement claiming that it had been published without their knowledge or approval   the statement was removed from the iau website shortly thereafter the iau media contact lars lindberg christensen stated that iau did not agree with the content of the letter and that it had been published by a group within the commission not iau itself  subsequent analysis of the data-processing used to identify phosphine in the atmosphere of venus has raised concerns that the detection-line may be an artefact the use of a -order polynomial fit may have amplified signal-noise and generated a false reading observations of the atmosphere of venus at other parts of the electromagnetic spectrum in which a phosphine absorption line would be expected did not detect phosphine  by late october  re-analysis of data with a proper subtraction of background did not result in the detection of phosphine    the committee on space re is a scientific organization established by the international council for science  among their responsibilities is the development of recommendations for avoiding interplanetary contamination  for this purpose space missions are categorized into five groups due to the harsh surface environment of venus venus has been under the planetary protection category two  this indicates that there is only a remote chance that spacecraft-borne contamination could compromise investigations though with the discovery of possible traces of indigenous life in the atmosphere of venus  this categorization has been questioned  list of missions to venus human presence in space venus is the place of the very first interplanetary human presence mediated through robotic missions with the first successful landings on another planet and extraterrestrial body other than the moon venus was at the beginning of the space age frequently visited by space probes until the  currently in orbit is akatsuki  and the parker solar probe routinely uses venus for gravity assist maneuvers  floating cities and islands in fiction venus terraforming of venus space infrastructure colonization of venus while the surface conditions of venus are very inhospitable the atmospheric pressure and temperature fifty kilometres above the surface are similar to those at earth surface this has led to proposals to use aerostats lighter-than-air balloons for exploration eg nasa havoc concept and possibly for permanent  floating cities  in the venusian atmosphere  among the many engineering challenges for any

continents and islands the remaining  is covered with water  mostly by oceans seas gulfs  and other salt-water bodies but also by lakes rivers and other freshwater which together constitute the hydrosphere  much of earth polar regions are covered in ice earth outer layer is divided into several rigid tectonic plates that migrate across the surface over many millions of years while its interior remains active with a solid iron inner core  a liquid outer core that generates earth magnetic field  and a convective mantle that drives plate tectonics earth atmosphere consists mostly of nitrogen and oxygen  more solar energy is received by tropical regions than polar regions and is redistributed by atmospheric and ocean circulation  greenhouse gases also play an important role in regulating the surface temperature a region climate is not only determined by latitude but also by elevation and proximity to moderating oceans among other factors severe weather such as tropical cyclones thunderstorms and heatwaves occurs in most areas and greatly impacts life earth gravity interacts with other objects in space especially the moon  which is earth only natural satellite  earth orbits around the sun in about  days earth axis of rotation is tilted with respect to its orbital plane producing seasons on earth the gravitational interaction between earth and the moon causes tides stabilizes earth orientation on its axis and gradually slows its rotation  earth is the densest planet in the solar system and the largest and most massive of the four rocky planets  according to radiometric dating estimation and other evidence earth formed over  billion years ago  within the first billion years of earth history  life appeared in the oceans and began to affect earth atmosphere and surface leading to the proliferation of anaerobic and later  aerobic organisms  some geological evidence indicates that life may have arisen as early as  billion years ago since then the combination of earth distance from the sun physical properties and geological history have allowed life to evolve and thrive in the history of life on earth  biodiversity has gone through long periods of expansion occasionally punctuated by mass extinctions  over  of all species that ever lived on earth are extinct almost billion humans live on earth and depend on its biosphere and natural resources for their survival humans increasingly impact earth surface hydrology atmospheric processes and other life contents the modern english word developed via middle english  from an old english noun most often spelled eore   it has cognates in every germanic language  and their ancestral root has been reconstructed as   in its earliest attestation the word was already being used to translate the many senses of latin terra and greek  the ground its soil  dry land the human world the surface of the world including the sea and the globe itself as with roman terra tells and greek gaia  earth may have been a personified goddess in germanic paganism  late norse mythology included jr  a giantess often given as the mother of thor   historically has been written in lowercase from early middle english  its definite sense as the globe was expressed as earth by early modern english  many nouns were capitalized and was also written  particularly when referenced along with other heavenly bodies more recently the name is sometimes simply given as  by analogy with the names of the other planets  though and forms with remain common  house styles now vary oxford spelling recognizes the lowercase form as the most common with the capitalized form an acceptable variant another convention capitalizes earth when appearing as a name for example earth atmosphere but writes it in lowercase when preceded by for example the atmosphere of the earth it almost always appears in lowercase in colloquial expressions such as what on earth are you ng  occasionally the name   is used in scientific writing and especially in science fiction to distinguish humanity inhabited planet from others  while in poetry   has been used to denote personification of the earth  is also the name of the planet in some romance languages languages that evolved from latin  like italian and portuguese  while in other romance languages the word gave rise to names with slightly altered spellings like the spanish and the french  the latinate form or     of the greek poetic name gaia   ia or jja  is rare though the alternative spelling has become common due to the gaia hypothesis  in which case its pronunciation is   rather than the more classical english     there are a number of adjectives for the planet earth from itself comes  from the latin comes     terrestrial     and via french     and from the latin comes    and   history of earth the oldest material found in the solar system is dated to ga billion years ago  by the primordial earth had formed  the bodies in the solar system formed and evolved with the sun in theory a solar nebula partitions a volume out of a molecular cloud by gravitational collapse which begins to spin and flatten into a circumstellar disk  and then the planets grow out of that disk with the sun a nebula contains gas ice grains and dust including primordial nuclides  according to nebular theory  planetesimals formed by accretion  with the primordial earth being estimated as likely taking anywhere from to million years to form  estimates of the age of the moon range from  ga to significantly younger  a leading hypothesis is that it was formed by accretion from material loosed from earth after a mars -sized object with about  of earth mass named theia  collided with earth  it hit earth with a glancing blow and some of its mass merged with earth   between approximately  and  numerous asteroid impacts during the late heavy bombardment caused significant changes to the greater surface environment of the moon and by inference to that of earth  geological history of earth carboniferous folded uplifted the orogeny supercontinent triassic algarve basin earth atmosphere and oceans were formed by volcanic activity and outgassing   water vapor from these sources condensed into the oceans augmented by water and ice from asteroids protoplanets  and comets   sufficient water to fill the oceans may have been on earth since it formed  in this model atmospheric greenhouse gases kept the oceans from freezing when the newly forming sun had only  of its current luminosity   by  earth magnetic field was established which helped prevent the atmosphere from being stripped away by the solar wind   as the molten outer layer of earth cooled it formed the first solid crust  which is thought to have been mafic in composition the first continental crust  which was more felsic in composition formed by the partial melting of this mafic crust the presence of grains of the mineral zircon of hadean age in eoarchean sedimentary rocks suggests that at least some felsic crust existed as early as  only ma after earth formation  there are two main models of how this initial small volume of continental crust evolved to reach its current abundance   a relatively steady growth up to the present day  which is supported by the radiometric dating of continental crust globally and  an initial rapid growth in the volume of continental crust during the archean  forming the bulk of the continental crust that now exists   which is supported by isotopic evidence from hafnium in zircons and neodymium in sedimentary rocks the two models and the data that support them can be reconciled by large-scale recycling of the continental crust  particularly during the early stages of earth history  new continental crust forms as a result of plate tectonics  a process ultimately driven by the continuous loss of heat from earth interior over the period of hundreds of millions of years tectonic forces have caused areas of continental crust to group together to form supercontinents that have subsequently broken apart at approximately  one of the earliest known supercontinents rodinia  began to break apart the continents later recombined to form pannotia at  then finally pangaea  which also began to break apart at   the most recent pattern of ice ages began about   and then intensified during the pleistocene about   high- and middle-latitude regions have since undergone repeated cycles of glaciation and thaw repeating about every   and  years  the last glacial period  colloquially called the last ice age covered large parts of the continents up to the middle latitudes in ice and ended about  years ago  life timeline water single-celled life photosynthesis eukaryotes multicellular life arthropods molluscs

about four billion years ago a half billion years later the last common ancestor of all current life arose  the evolution of photosynthesis allowed the sun energy to be harvested directly by life forms the resultant molecular oxygen   accumulated in the atmosphere and due to interaction with ultraviolet solar radiation formed a protective ozone layer   in the upper atmosphere  the incorporation of smaller cells within larger ones resulted in the development of complex cells called eukaryotes   true multicellular organisms formed as cells within colonies became increasingly specialized aided by the absorption of harmful ultraviolet radiation by the ozone layer life colonized earth surface  among the earliest fossil evidence for life is microbial mat fossils found in -year-old sandstone in western australia   biogenic graphite found in -year-old metasedimentary rocks in western greenland   and remains of biotic material found in -year-old rocks in western australia   the earliest direct evidence of life on earth is contained in  billion-year-old australian rocks showing fossils of microorganisms    during the neoproterozoic   much of earth might have been covered in ice this hypothesis has been termed  snowball earth  and it is of particular interest because it preceded the cambrian explosion  when multicellular life forms significantly increased in complexity   following the cambrian explosion  there have been at least five major mass extinctions and many minor ones   apart from the proposed current holocene extinction event the most recent was  when an asteroid impact triggered the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs and other large reptiles but largely spared small animals such as insects  mammals  lizards and birds  mammalian life has diversified over the past  and several million years ago an african ape gained the ability to stand upright  this facilitated tool use and encouraged communication that provided the nutrition and stimulation needed for a larger brain which led to the evolution of humans  the development of agriculture  and then civilization  led to humans having an influence on earth and the nature and quantity of other life forms that continues to this day  future of earth global catastrophic risk because carbon dioxide   has a long lifespan in the atmosphere moderate human emissions may postpone the next glacial inception by  years  earth expected long-term future is tied to that of the sun over the next  solar luminosity will increase by  and over the next by   earth increasing surface temperature will accelerate the inorganic carbon cycle  reducing concentration to levels lethally low for plants  ppm for photosynthesis  in approximately    the lack of vegetation will result in the loss of oxygen in the atmosphere making animal life impossible  due to the increased luminosity earth mean temperature may reach  in  billion years and all ocean water will evaporate and be lost to space within an estimated  to billion years  even if the sun were stable a fraction of the water in the modern oceans will descend to the mantle  due to reduced steam venting from mid-ocean ridges   the sun will evolve to become a red giant in about  models predict that the sun will expand to roughly au   about times its present radius   earth fate is less clear as a red giant the sun will lose roughly  of its mass so without tidal effects earth will move to an orbit    from the sun when the star reaches its maximum radius  figure of the earth earth radius earth circumference list of highest mountains on earth chimborazo  the shape of earth is nearly spherical there is a small flattening at the poles and bulging around the equator due to earth rotation   therefore a better approximation of earth shape is an oblate spheroid  whose equatorial diameter is kilometres  larger than the pole -to-pole diameter  the point on the surface farthest from earth center of mass is the summit of the equatorial chimborazo volcano in ecuador  or     the average diameter of the reference spheroid is  kilometres  local topography deviates from this idealized spheroid although on a global scale these deviations are small compared to earth radius the maximum deviation of only  is at the mariana trench  metres or  feet below local sea level  whereas mount everest  metres or  feet above local sea level represents a deviation of  n   in geodesy  the exact shape that earth oceans would adopt in the absence of land and perturbations such as tides and winds is called the geoid  more precisely the geoid is the surface of gravitational equipotential at mean sea level msl  sea surface topography are water deviations from msl analogous to land topography abundance of elements on earth   silica

plates  beneath the lithosphere is the asthenosphere  a relatively low-viscosity layer on which the lithosphere rides important changes in crystal structure within the mantle occur at and  and  below the surface spanning a transition zone that separates the upper and lower mantle beneath the mantle an extremely low viscosity liquid outer core lies above a solid inner core   earth inner core may be rotating at a slightly higher angular velocity than the remainder of the planet advancing by  per year although both somewhat higher and much lower rates have also been proposed  the radius of the inner core is about one-fifth of that of earth density increases with depth as described in the table on the right earth internal heat budget the major heat-producing isotopes within earth are potassium-  uranium-  and thorium-   at the center the temperature may be up to    and the pressure could reach gpa  psi   because much of the heat is provided by radioactive decay scientists postulate that early in earth history before isotopes with short half-lives were depleted earth heat production was much higher at approximately gyr  twice the present-day heat would have been produced increasing the rates of mantle convection and plate tectonics and allowing the production of uncommon igneous rocks such as komatiites that are rarely formed today    the mean heat loss from earth is  for a global heat loss of   a portion of the core thermal energy is transported toward the crust by mantle plumes  a form of convection consisting of upwellings of higher-temperature rock these plumes can produce hotspots and flood basalts   more of the heat in earth is lost through plate tectonics by mantle upwelling associated with mid-ocean ridges  the final major mode of heat loss is through conduction through the lithosphere the majority of which occurs under the oceans because the crust there is much thinner than that of the continents  plate tectonics earth major plates  pacific plate african plate n  north american plate eurasian plate antarctic plate indo-australian plate south american plate earth mechanically rigid outer layer the lithosphere is divided into tectonic plates these plates are rigid segments that move relative to each other at one of three boundaries types at convergent boundaries  two plates come together at divergent boundaries  two plates are pulled apart and at transform boundaries  two plates slide past one another laterally along these plate boundaries earthquakes  volcanic activity  mountain-building  and oceanic trench formation can occur  the tectonic plates ride on top of the asthenosphere the solid but less-viscous part of the upper mantle that can flow and move along with the plates  as the tectonic plates migrate oceanic crust is subducted under the leading edges of the plates at convergent boundaries at the same time the upwelling of mantle material at divergent boundaries creates mid-ocean ridges the combination of these processes recycles the oceanic crust back into the mantle due to this recycling most of the ocean floor is less than old the oldest oceanic crust is located in the western pacific and is estimated to be old   by comparison the oldest dated continental crust is   although zircons have been found preserved as clasts within eoarchean sedimentary rocks that give ages up to  indicating that at least some continental crust existed at that time  the seven major plates are the pacific  north american  eurasian  african  antarctic  indo-australian  and south american  other notable plates include the arabian plate  the caribbean plate  the nazca plate off the west coast of south america and the scotia plate in the southern atlantic ocean the australian plate fused with the indian plate between  the fastest-moving plates are the oceanic plates with the cocos plate advancing at a rate of a year  and the pacific plate moving a year at the other extreme the slowest-moving plate is the south american plate progressing at a typical rate of a year  earth crust landform extreme points of earth planetary surface geomorphology the total surface area of earth is about   of this   or   is below sea level and covered by ocean water  below the ocean surface are much of the continental shelf  mountains volcanoes  oceanic trenches submarine canyons  oceanic plateaus  abyssal plains and a globe-spanning mid-ocean ridge system the remaining  or   not covered by water has terrain that varies greatly from place to place and consists of mountains deserts plains plateaus and other landforms  the elevation of the land surface varies from the low point of  at the dead sea  to a maximum altitude of   at the top of mount everest the mean height of land above sea level is about   the continental crust consists of lower density material such as the igneous rocks granite and andesite  less common is basalt  a denser volcanic rock that is the primary constituent of the ocean floors  sedimentary rock is formed from the accumulation of sediment that becomes buried and compacted together  nearly  of the continental surfaces are covered by sedimentary rocks although they form about  of the crust  the third form of rock material found on earth is metamorphic rock  which is created from the transformation of pre-existing rock types through high pressures high temperatures or both the most abundant silicate minerals on earth surface include quartz  feldspars  amphibole  mica  pyroxene and olivine   common carbonate minerals include calcite found in limestone  and dolomite   erosion and tectonics  volcanic eruptions  flooding  weathering  glaciation  the growth of coral reefs  and meteorite impacts are among the processes that constantly reshape earth surface over geological time    the pedosphere is the outermost layer of earth continental surface and is composed of soil and subject to soil formation processes  the total arable land is  of the land surface with  being permanent cropland   close to  of earth land surface is used for agriculture or an estimated   of cropland and   of pastureland  gravity of earth grace theoretical gravity the gravity of earth is the acceleration that is imparted to objects due to the distribution of mass within earth near earth surface gravitational acceleration is approximately s s  local differences in topography geology  and deeper tectonic structure cause local and broad regional differences in earth gravitational field known as gravity anomalies   earth magnetic field the main part of earth magnetic field is generated in the core the site of a dynamo process that converts the kinetic energy of thermally and compositionally driven convection into electrical and magnetic field energy the field extends outwards from the core through the mantle and up to earth surface where it is approximately a dipole  the poles of the dipole are located close to earth geographic poles at the equator of the magnetic field the magnetic-field strength at the surface is t  with a magnetic dipole moment of at epoch  decreasing nearly  per century  the convection movements in the core are chaotic the magnetic poles drift and periodically change alignment this causes secular variation of the main field and field reversals at irregular intervals averaging a few times every million years the most recent reversal occurred approximately  years ago   magnetosphere the extent of earth magnetic field in space defines the magnetosphere  ions and electrons of the solar wind are deflected by the magnetosphere solar wind pressure compresses the dayside of the magnetosphere to about earth radii and extends the nightside magnetosphere into a long tail  because the velocity of the solar wind is greater than the speed at which waves propagate through the solar wind a supersonic bow shock precedes the dayside magnetosphere within the solar wind  charged particles are contained within the magnetosphere the plasmasphere is defined by low-energy particles that essentially follow magnetic field lines as earth rotates   the ring current is defined by medium-energy particles that drift relative to the geomagnetic field but with paths that are still dominated by the magnetic field  and the van allen radiation belts are formed by high-energy particles whose motion is essentially random but contained in the magnetosphere   during magnetic storms and substorms  charged particles can be deflected from the outer magnetosphere and especially the magnetotail directed along field lines into earth ionosphere where atmospheric atoms can be excited and ionized causing the aurora   earth rotation dscovr epic solstice earth rotation period relative to the sunits mean solar dayis of mean solar time  si   because earth solar day is now slightly longer than it was during the century due to tidal deceleration  each day varies between ms longer than the mean solar day   earth rotation period relative to the fixed stars  called its by the international earth rotation and reference systems service iers is of mean solar time   or  n  earth rotation period relative to the precessing or moving mean march equinox when the sun is at on the equator is of mean solar time    thus the sidereal day is shorter than the stellar day by about   apart from meteors within the atmosphere and low-orbiting satellites the main apparent motion of celestial bodies in earth sky is to the west at a rate of h  min for bodies near the celestial equator  this is equivalent to an apparent diameter of the sun or the moon every two minutes from earth surface the apparent sizes of the sun and the moon are approximately the same   earth orbit pale blue dot voyager light speed  earth orbits the sun at an average distance of about  every  mean solar days or one sidereal year  this gives an apparent movement of the sun eastward with respect to the stars at a rate of about day which is one apparent sun or moon diameter every  due to this motion on average it takes solar day for earth to complete a full rotation about its axis so that the sun returns to the meridian  the orbital speed of earth averages about s h  which is fast enough to travel a distance equal to earth diameter about   in seven minutes and the distance to the moon   in about  hours  the moon and earth orbit a common barycenter every  relative to the background stars when combined with the earth-moon system common orbit around the sun the period of the synodic month  from new moon to new moon is  viewed from the celestial north pole  the motion of earth the moon and their axial rotations are all counterclockwise  viewed from a vantage point above the sun and earth north poles earth orbits in a counterclockwise direction about the sun the orbital and axial planes are not precisely aligned earth axis is tilted some  from the perpendicular to the earth-sun plane the ecliptic  and the earth-moon plane is tilted up to  against the earth-sun plane without this tilt there would be an eclipse every two weeks alternating between lunar eclipses and solar eclipses    the hill sphere  or the sphere of gravitational influence of earth is about   in radius  n  this is the maximum distance at which earth gravitational influence is stronger than the more distant sun and planets objects must orbit earth within this radius or they can become unbound by the gravitational perturbation of the sun  earth along with the solar system is situated in the milky way and orbits about  light-years from its center it is about -years above the galactic plane in the orion arm   axial tilt earth obliquity rotation plane of orbit the axial tilt of earth is approximately   with the axis of its orbit plane always pointing towards the celestial poles  due to earth axial tilt the amount of sunlight reaching any given point on the surface varies over the course of the year this causes the seasonal change in climate with summer in the northern hemisphere occurring when the tropic of cancer is facing the sun and in the southern hemisphere when the tropic of capricorn faces the sun in each instance winter occurs simultaneously in the opposite hemisphere during the summer the day lasts longer and the sun climbs higher in the sky in winter the climate becomes cooler and the days shorter  above the arctic circle and below the antarctic circle there is no daylight at all for part of the year causing a polar night  and this night extends for several months at the poles themselves these same latitudes also experience a midnight sun  where the sun remains visible all day   by astronomical convention the four seasons can be determined by the solsticesthe points in the orbit of maximum axial tilt toward or away from the sunand the equinoxes  when earth rotational axis is aligned with its orbital axis in the northern hemisphere winter solstice currently occurs around december summer solstice is near june spring equinox is around march and autumnal equinox is about or september in the southern hemisphere the situation is reversed with the summer and winter solstices exchanged and the spring and autumnal equinox dates swapped  the angle of earth axial tilt is relatively stable over long periods of time its axial tilt does undergo nutation  a slight irregular motion with a main period of   the orientation rather than the angle of earth axis also changes over time precessing around in a complete circle over each -year cycle this precession is the reason for the difference between a sidereal year and a tropical year  both of these motions are caused by the varying attraction of the sun and the moon on earth equatorial bulge the poles also migrate a few meters across earth surface this polar motion has multiple cyclical components which collectively are termed quasiperiodic motion  in addition to an annual component to this motion there is a -month cycle called the chandler wobble  earth rotational velocity also varies in a phenomenon known as length-of-day variation  in modern times earth perihelion occurs around january and its aphelion around july these dates change over time due to precession and other orbital factors which follow cyclical patterns known as milankovitch cycles  the changing earth-sun distance causes an increase of about  in solar energy reaching earth at perihelion relative to aphelion  n  because the southern hemisphere is tilted toward the sun at about the same time that earth reaches the closest approach to the sun the southern hemisphere receives slightly more energy from the sun than does the northern over the course of a year this effect is much less significant than the total energy change due to the axial tilt and most of the excess energy is absorbed by the higher proportion of water in the southern hemisphere  orbit of the moon satellite system astronomy claimed moons of earth quasi-satellite co-orbital moon co-orbital configuration temporary satellite moon lunar theory diameter mass semi-major axis orbital period the moon is a relatively large terrestrial  planet-like natural satellite  with a diameter about one-quarter of earth it is the largest moon in the solar system relative to the size of its planet although charon is larger relative to the dwarf planet pluto    the natural satellites of other planets are also referred to as moons after earth  the most widely accepted theory of the moon origin the giant-impact hypothesis  states that it formed from the collision of a mars-size protoplanet called theia with the early earth this hypothesis explains among other things the moon relative lack of iron and volatile elements and the fact that its composition is nearly identical to that of earth crust  the gravitational attraction between earth and the moon causes tides on earth  the same effect on the moon has led to its tidal locking  its rotation period is the same as the time it takes to orbit earth as a result it always presents the same face to the planet  as the moon orbits earth different parts of its face are illuminated by the sun leading to the lunar phases   due to their tidal interaction the moon recedes from earth at the rate of approximately a year over millions of years these tiny modificationsand the lengthening of earth day by about s yradd up to significant changes  during the ediacaran period for example approximately  there were days in a year with each day lasting  hours  the moon may have dramatically affected the development of life by moderating the planet climate paleontological evidence and computer simulations show that earth axial tilt is stabilized by tidal interactions with the moon  some theorists think that without this stabilization against the torques applied by the sun and planets to earth equatorial bulge the rotational axis might be chaotically unstable exhibiting large changes over millions of years as is the case for mars though this is disputed   viewed from earth the moon is just far enough away to have almost the same apparent-sized disk as the sun the angular size or solid angle  of these two bodies match because although the sun diameter is about times as large as the moon it is also times more distant  this allows total and annular solar eclipses to occur on earth  near-earth object tracy caldwell dyson iss earth co-orbital asteroids population consists of quasi-satellites  objects with a horseshoe orbit and trojans  there are at least five quasi-satellites including kamooalewa    a trojan asteroid companion tk  is librating around the leading lagrange triangular point   in earth orbit around the sun   the tiny near-earth asteroid rh makes close approaches to the earthmoon system roughly every twenty years during these approaches it can orbit earth for brief periods of time  as of update  there are  operational human-made satellites orbiting earth  there are also inoperative satellites including vanguard  the oldest satellite currently in orbit and over  pieces of tracked space debris  n  earth largest artificial satellite is the international space station   hydrosphere water cycle the abundance of water on earth surface is a unique feature that distinguishes the blue planet from other planets in the solar system earth hydrosphere consists chiefly of the oceans but technically includes all water surfaces in the world including inland seas lakes rivers and underground waters down to a depth of   the mass of the oceans is approximately  metric tons or about  of earth total mass the oceans cover an area of   with a mean depth of   resulting in an estimated volume of    if all of earth crustal surface were at the same elevation as a smooth sphere the depth of the resulting world ocean would be  to   to   about  of the water is saline  the remaining  is fresh water    most fresh water about  is present as ice in ice caps and glaciers   in earth coldest regions snow survives over the summer and changes into ice  this accumulated snow and ice eventually forms into glaciers  bodies of ice that flow under the influence of their own gravity alpine glaciers form in mountainous areas whereas vast ice sheets form over land in polar regions the flow of glaciers erodes the surface changing it dramatically with the formation of u-shaped valleys and other landforms  sea ice in the arctic covers an area about as big as the united states although it is quickly retreating as a consequence of climate change  the average salinity of earth oceans is about of salt per kilogram of seawater  salt  most of this salt was released from volcanic activity or extracted from cool igneous rocks  the oceans are also a reservoir of dissolved atmospheric gases which are essential for the survival of many aquatic life forms  sea water has an important influence on the world climate with the oceans acting as a large heat reservoir   shifts in the oceanic temperature distribution can cause significant weather shifts such as the el niosouthern oscillation   atmosphere of earth cloud cover nasa moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer the atmospheric pressure at earth sea level averages    with a scale height of about    a dry atmosphere is composed of  nitrogen   oxygen  argon  and trace amounts of carbon dioxide and other gaseous molecules  water vapor content varies between  and   but averages about   the height of the troposphere varies with latitude ranging between  at the poles to  at the equator with some variation resulting from weather and seasonal factors  earth biosphere has significantly altered its atmosphere  oxygenic photosynthesis evolved  forming the primarily nitrogenoxygen atmosphere of today  this change enabled the proliferation of aerobic organisms and indirectly the formation of the ozone layer due to the subsequent conversion of atmospheric into  the ozone layer blocks ultraviolet solar radiation  permitting life on land  other atmospheric functions important to life include transporting water vapor providing useful gases causing small meteors to burn up before they strike the surface and moderating temperature  this last phenomenon is known as the greenhouse effect  trace molecules within the atmosphere serve to capture thermal energy emitted from the ground thereby raising the average temperature water vapor carbon dioxide methane  nitrous oxide  and ozone are the primary greenhouse gases in the atmosphere without this heat-retention effect the average surface temperature would be  in contrast to the current    and life on earth probably would not exist in its current form  weather climate earth atmosphere has no definite boundary gradually becoming thinner and fading into outer space three-quarters of the atmosphere mass is contained within the first  of the surface this lowest layer is called the troposphere energy from the sun heats this layer and the surface below causing expansion of the air this lower-density air then rises and is replaced by cooler higher-density air the result is atmospheric circulation that drives the weather and climate through redistribution of thermal energy  hurricane felix mojave desert the primary atmospheric circulation bands consist of the trade winds in the equatorial region below latitude and the westerlies in the mid-latitudes between and   ocean currents are also important factors in determining climate particularly the thermohaline circulation that distributes thermal energy from the equatorial oceans to the polar regions  the amount of solar energy reaching the earth surface decreases with increasing latitude at higher latitudes the sunlight reaches the surface at lower angles and it must pass through thicker columns of the atmosphere as a result the mean annual air temperature at sea level decreases by about   per degree of latitude from the equator  earth surface can be subdivided into specific latitudinal belts of approximately homogeneous climate ranging from the equator to the polar regions these are the tropical or equatorial subtropical  temperate and polar climates  further factors that affect a location climates are its proximity to oceans  the oceanic and atmospheric circulation and topology  places close to oceans typically have colder summers and warmer winters due to the fact that oceans can store large amounts of heat the wind transports the cold or the heat of the ocean to the land  atmospheric circulation also plays an important role san francisco and washington dc are both coastal cities at about the same latitude san francisco climate is significantly more moderate as the prevailing wind direction is from sea to land  finally temperatures decrease with height causing mountainous areas to be colder than low-lying areas  water vapor generated through surface evaporation is transported by circulatory patterns in the atmosphere when atmospheric conditions permit an uplift of warm humid air this water condenses and falls to the surface as precipitation  most of the water is then transported to lower elevations by river systems and usually returned to the oceans or deposited into lakes this water cycle is a vital mechanism for supporting life on land and is a primary factor in the erosion of surface features over geological periods precipitation patterns vary widely ranging from several meters of water per year to less than a millimeter atmospheric circulation topographic features and temperature differences determine the average precipitation that falls in each region  the commonly used kppen climate classification system has five broad groups  humid tropics  arid  humid middle latitudes  continental and cold polar  which are further divided into more specific subtypes  the kppen system rates regions based on observed temperature and precipitation  surface air temperature can rise to around  in hot deserts  such as death valley  and can fall as low as  in antarctica    full moon above the troposphere the atmosphere is usually divided into the stratosphere  mesosphere  and thermosphere   each layer has a different lapse rate defining the rate of change in temperature with height beyond these the exosphere thins out into the magnetosphere where the geomagnetic fields interact with the solar wind  within the stratosphere is the ozone layer a component that partially shields the surface from ultraviolet light and thus is important for life on earth the krmn line  defined as  above earth surface is a working definition for the boundary between the atmosphere and outer space   thermal energy causes some of the molecules at the outer edge of the atmosphere to increase their velocity to the point where they can escape from earth gravity this causes a slow but steady loss of the atmosphere into space  because unfixed hydrogen has a low molecular mass  it can achieve escape velocity more readily and it leaks into outer space at a greater rate than other gases  the leakage of hydrogen into space contributes to the shifting of earth atmosphere and surface from an initially reducing state to its current oxidizing one photosynthesis provided a source of free oxygen but the loss of reducing agents such as hydrogen is thought to have been a necessary precondition for the widespread accumulation of oxygen in the atmosphere  hence the ability of hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere may have influenced the nature of life that developed on earth  in the current oxygen-rich atmosphere most hydrogen is converted into water before it has an opportunity to escape instead most of the hydrogen loss comes from the destruction of methane in the upper atmosphere  life fungi a planet life forms inhabit ecosystems  whose total forms the biosphere   the biosphere is divided into a number of biomes  inhabited by broadly similar plants and animals  on land biomes are separated primarily by differences in latitude height above sea level and humidity  terrestrial biomes lying within the arctic or antarctic circles at high altitudes or in extremely arid areas are relatively barren of plant and animal life species diversity reaches a peak in humid lowlands at equatorial latitudes   estimates of the number of species on earth today vary most species have not been described   over  of all species that ever lived on earth are extinct    a planet that can sustain life is termed habitable  even if life did not originate there the distance of earth from the sun as well as its orbital eccentricity rate of rotation axial tilt geological history sustaining atmosphere and magnetic field all contribute to the current climatic conditions at the surface  earth provides liquid wateran environment where complex organic molecules can assemble and interact and sufficient energy to sustain metabolism   plants can take up nutrients from the atmosphere soils and water these nutrients are constantly recycled between different species  extreme weather such as tropical cyclones including hurricanes and typhoons  occurs over most of earth

 deforestation  desertification  loss of wildlife species extinction  soil degradation  soil depletion and erosion   human activities release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere which cause global warming   this is driving changes such as the melting of glaciers and ice sheets  a global rise in average sea levels  increased risk of drought and wildfires and migration of species to colder areas

up of six people is usually replaced every six months  the farthest that humans have traveled from earth is   achieved during the apollo mission in   natural resource land use  earth has resources that have been exploited by humans  those termed non-renewable resources  such as fossil fuels  are only replenished over geological timescales  large deposits of fossil fuels are obtained from earth crust consisting of coal  petroleum  and natural gas   these deposits are used by humans both for energy production and as feedstock for chemical production  mineral ore bodies have also been formed within the crust through a process of ore genesis  resulting from actions of magmatism  erosion and plate tectonics  these metals and other elements are extracted by mining  a process which often

its climate     it is estimated that global temperatures in the year were   warmer than the preindustrial baseline  this increase in temperature known as global warming  has contributed to the melting of glaciers  rising sea levels  increased risk of drought and wildfires and migration of species to colder areas  earth in culture earthrise william anders human cultures have developed many views of the planet  the standard astronomical symbol of earth consists of a cross circumscribed by a circle    representing the four corners of the world  earth is sometimes personified as a deity  in many cultures it is a mother goddess that is also the primary fertility deity   creation myths in many religions involve the creation of earth by a supernatural deity or deities  the gaia hypothesis  developed in the mid- century compared earth environments and life as a single self-regulating organism leading to broad stabilization of the conditions of habitability    images of earth taken from space particularly during the apollo program have been credited with altering the way that people viewed the planet that they lived on emphasizing its beauty uniqueness and apparent fragility   scientific investigation has resulted in several culturally transformative shifts in people view of the planet initial belief in a flat earth was gradually displaced in ancient greece by the idea of a spherical earth  which was attributed to both the philosophers pythagoras and parmenides    earth was generally believed to be the center of the universe until the century when scientists first concluded that it was a moving object  comparable to the other planets in the solar system  it was only during the century that geologists realized earth age was at least many millions of years  lord kelvin used thermodynamics to estimate the age of earth to be between million and years in  sparking a vigorous debate on the subject it was only when radioactivity and radioactive dating were discovered in the late and early centuries that a reliable mechanism for determining earth age was established proving the planet to be billions of years old   celestial sphere earth phase earth

largest natural satellite in the solar system relative to the size of its planet f the fifth largest satellite in the solar system overall and is larger than any dwarf planet  orbiting earth at an average distance of    or about times earth diameter its gravitational influence slightly lengthens earth day and is the main driver of earth tides  the moon is classified as a planetary-mass object and a differentiated rocky body and lacks any significant atmosphere  hydrosphere  or magnetic field  its surface gravity is about one-sixth of earth  g  jupiter moon io is the only satellite in the solar system known to have a higher surface gravity and density the moon orbit around earth has a sidereal period of  days during each synodic period of  days the amount of visible surface illuminated by the sun varies from none up to  resulting in lunar phases that form the basis for the months of a lunar calendar  the moon is tidally locked to earth which means that the length of a full rotation of the moon on its own axis causes its same side  the near side  to always face earth and the somewhat longer lunar day is the same as the synodic period that said  of the total lunar surface can be seen from earth through shifts in perspective due to libration   the most widely accepted origin explanation posits that the moon formed about  years ago not long after earth  out of the debris from a giant impact between the planet and a hypothesized mars -sized body called theia  it then receded to a wider orbit because of tidal interaction with the earth the near side of the moon is marked by dark volcanic maria seas which fill the spaces between bright ancient crustal highlands and prominent impact craters  most of the large impact basins and mare surfaces were in place by the end of the imbrian period some three billion years ago the lunar surface is relatively non-reflective with a reflectance just slightly brighter than that of worn asphalt  however because it has a large angular diameter  the full moon is the brightest celestial object in the night sky the moon apparent size is nearly the same as that of the sun allowing it to cover the sun almost completely during a total solar eclipse  both the moon prominence in the earthly sky and its regular cycle of phases have provided cultural references and influences for human societies throughout history such influences can be found in language calendar systems art and mythology
the first artificial object to reach the moon was the soviet union luna uncrewed spacecraft in  this was followed by the first successful soft landing by luna in  the only human lunar missions to date have been those of the united states  apollo program  which landed twelve men on the surface between and  these and later uncrewed missions returned lunar rocks that have been used to develop a detailed geological understanding of the moon origins  internal structure  and subsequent history contents list of lunar deities the usual english proper name for earth natural satellite is simply the moon  with a capital m   the noun is derived from old english  which like all its germanic cognates stems from proto-germanic   which in turn comes from proto-indo-european month  from earlier  genitive  which may be related to the verb measure of time  vincent van gogh the starry night occasionally the name luna   is used in scientific writing  and especially in science fiction to distinguish the earth moon from others while in poetry luna has been used to denote personification of the moon  cynthia   is another poetic name though rare for the moon personified as a goddess  while selene   literally moon is the greek goddess of the moon the usual english adjective pertaining to the moon is lunar derived from the latin word for the moon  the adjective     derived from the greek word for the moon  and used to describe the moon as a world rather than as an object in the sky is rare  while its cognate was originally a rare synonym  but now nearly always refers to the chemical element selenium   the greek word for the moon does however provide us with the prefix  as in selenography  the study of the physical features of the moon as well as the element name    the greek goddess of the wilderness and the hunt artemis  equated with the roman diana  one of whose symbols was the moon and who was often regarded as the goddess of the moon was also called cynthia  from her legendary birthplace on mount cynthus   these names luna cynthia and selene are reflected in technical terms for lunar orbits such as  and  near side of the moon far side of the moon lunar north pole lunar south pole origin of the moon giant-impact hypothesis circumplanetary disk isotope dating of lunar samples suggests the moon formed around years after the origin of the solar system    historically several formation mechanisms have been proposed  but none satisfactorily explained the features of the earthmoon system a fission of the moon from earth crust through centrifugal force  would require too great an initial rotation rate of earth  gravitational capture of a pre-formed moon  depends on an unfeasibly extended atmosphere of earth to dissipate the energy of the passing moon  a co-formation of earth and the moon together in the primordial accretion disk does not explain the depletion of metals in the moon  none of these hypotheses can account for the high angular momentum of the earthmoon system  the prevailing theory is that the earthmoon system formed after a giant impact of a mars -sized body named theia  with the proto-earth  the impact blasted material into earth orbit and then the material accreted and formed the moon   just beyond the earth roche limit of    this theory best explains the evidence giant impacts are thought to have been common in the early solar system computer simulations of giant impacts have produced results that are consistent with the mass of the lunar core and the angular momentum of the earthmoon system these simulations also show that most of the moon derived from the impactor rather than the proto-earth  however more recent simulations suggest a larger fraction of the moon derived from the proto-earth     other bodies of the inner solar system such as mars and vesta have according to meteorites from them very different oxygen and tungsten isotopic compositions compared to earth however earth and the moon have nearly identical isotopic compositions the isotopic equalization of the earth-moon system might be explained by the post-impact mixing of the vaporized material that formed the two  although this is debated  the impact released a lot of energy and then the released material re-accreted into the earthmoon system this would have melted the outer shell of earth and thus formed a magma ocean   similarly the newly formed moon would also have been affected and had its own lunar magma ocean  its depth is estimated from about  miles to   miles  oceanus procellarum rift valleys grail gravity gradients rift valleys rift valleys while the giant-impact theory explains many lines of evidence some questions are still unresolved most of which involve the moon composition  in  a team at the carnegie institute of washington reported the most precise measurement of the isotopic signatures of lunar rocks  the rocks from the apollo program had the same isotopic signature as rocks from earth differing from almost all other bodies in the solar system this observation was unexpected because most of the material that formed the moon was thought to come from theia and it was announced in that there was less than a  chance that theia and earth had identical isotopic signatures  other apollo lunar samples had in the same titanium isotopes composition as earth  which conflicts with what is expected if the moon formed far from earth or is derived from theia these discrepancies may be explained by variations of the giant-impact theory the moon is a very slightly scalene ellipsoid due to tidal stretching with its long axis displaced from facing the earth due to gravitational anomalies from impact basins its shape is more elongated than current tidal forces can account for this bulge indicates that the moon solidified when it orbited at half its current distance to the earth and that it is now too cold for its shape to adjust to its orbit  internal structure of the moon  silica alumina lime ironii oxide magnesia titanium dioxide sodium oxide the moon is a differentiated body that was initially in hydrostatic equilibrium but has since departed from this condition  it has a geochemically distinct crust  mantle  and core  the moon has a solid iron-rich inner core with a radius possibly as small as kilometres  and a fluid outer core primarily made of liquid iron with a radius of roughly kilometres  around the core is a partially molten boundary layer with a radius of about kilometres    this structure is thought to have developed through the fractional crystallization of a global magma ocean shortly after the moon formation  years ago  crystallization of this magma ocean would have created a mafic mantle from the precipitation and sinking of the minerals olivine  clinopyroxene  and orthopyroxene  after about three-quarters of the magma ocean had crystallised lower-density plagioclase minerals could form and float into a crust atop  the final liquids to crystallise would have been initially sandwiched between the crust and mantle with a high abundance of incompatible and heat-producing elements  consistent with this perspective geochemical mapping made from orbit suggests a crust of mostly anorthosite   the moon rock samples of the flood lavas that erupted onto the surface from partial melting in the mantle confirm the mafic mantle composition which is more iron-rich than that of earth  the crust is on average about kilometres  thick  the moon is the second-densest satellite in the solar system after io   however the inner core of the moon is small with a radius of about kilometres  or less  around  of the radius of the moon its composition is not well understood but is probably metallic iron alloyed with a small amount of sulfur and nickel analyses of the moon time-variable rotation suggest that it is at least partly molten  the pressure at the lunar core is estimated to be gpa   magnetic field of the moon the moon has an external magnetic field of generally less than  nanoteslas   or less than one hundred thousandth that of earth  the moon does not currently have a global dipolar magnetic field and only has crustal magnetization likely acquired early in its history when a dynamo was still operating   however early in its history billion years ago its magnetic field strength was likely close to that of earth today  this early dynamo field apparently expired by about one billion years ago after the lunar core had completely crystallized  theoretically some of the remnant magnetization may originate from transient magnetic fields generated during large impacts through the expansion of plasma clouds these clouds are generated during large impacts in an ambient magnetic field this is supported by the location of the largest crustal magnetizations situated near the antipodes of the giant impact basins  topography of the moon geology of the moon moon rock list of lunar features the topography of the moon has been measured with laser altimetry and stereo image analysis   its most extensive topographic feature is the giant far-side south poleaitken basin  some   in diameter the largest crater on the moon and the second-largest confirmed impact crater in the solar system    at  deep its floor is the lowest point on the surface of the moon   the highest elevations of the moon surface are located directly to the northeast which might have been thickened by the oblique formation impact of the south poleaitken basin  other large impact basins such as imbrium  serenitatis  crisium  smythii  and orientale possess regionally low elevations and elevated rims  the far side of the lunar surface is on average about   higher than that of the near side  the discovery of fault scarp cliffs suggest that the moon has shrunk by about metres  within the past billion years  similar shrinkage features exist on mercury  mare frigoris a basin near the north pole long assumed to be geologically dead has cracked and shifted since the moon doesn have tectonic plates its tectonic activity is slow and cracks develop as it loses heat  volcanism on the moon the dark and relatively featureless lunar plains clearly seen with the naked eye are called maria  latin for seas singular  as they were once believed to be filled with water  they are now known to be vast solidified pools of ancient basaltic lava although similar to terrestrial basalts lunar basalts have more iron and no minerals altered by water  the majority of these lava deposits erupted or flowed into the depressions associated with impact basins  several geologic provinces containing shield volcanoes and volcanic domes are found within the near side maria  young lunar volcanism almost all maria are on the near side of the moon and cover  of the surface of the near side  compared with  of the far side  this is likely due to a concentration of heat-producing elements under the crust on the near side which would have caused the underlying mantle to heat up partially melt rise to the surface and erupt    most of the moon mare basalts erupted during the imbrian period  years ago although some radiometrically dated samples are as old as  years  as of  crater counting studies of the youngest eruptions appeared to suggest they formed no earlier than  years ago  in  a study of ina  a tiny depression in lacus felicitatis  found jagged relatively dust-free features that because of the lack of erosion by infalling debris appeared to be only million years old  moonquakes and releases of gas also indicate some continued lunar activity  evidence of recent lunar volcanism has been identified at irregular mare patches  some less than million years old this raises the possibility of a much warmer lunar mantle than previously believed at least on the near side where the deep crust is substantially warmer because of the greater concentration of radioactive elements     evidence has been found for million years old basaltic volcanism within the crater lowell   inside the orientale basin some combination of an initially hotter mantle and local enrichment of heat-producing elements in the mantle could be responsible for prolonged activities on the far side in the orientale basin   the lighter-colored regions of the moon are called  or more commonly  because they are higher than most maria they have been radiometrically dated to having formed  years ago and may represent plagioclase cumulates of the lunar magma ocean   in contrast to earth no major lunar mountains are believed to have formed as a result of tectonic events  the concentration of maria on the near side likely reflects the substantially thicker crust of the highlands of the far side which may have formed in a slow-velocity impact of a second moon of earth a few tens of millions of years after the moon formation   alternatively it may be a consequence of asymmetrical tidal heating when the moon was much closer to the earth  list of craters on the moon daedalus moon far side a major geologic process that has affected the moon surface is impact cratering   with craters formed when asteroids and comets collide with the lunar surface there are estimated to be roughly  craters wider than  on the moon near side  the lunar geologic timescale is based on the most prominent impact events including nectaris  imbrium  and orientale  structures characterized by multiple rings of uplifted material between hundreds and thousands of kilometers in diameter and associated with a broad apron of ejecta deposits that form a regional stratigraphic horizon   the lack of an atmosphere weather and recent geological processes mean that many of these craters are well-preserved although only a few multi-ring basins have been definitively dated they are useful for assigning relative ages because impact craters accumulate at a nearly constant rate counting the number of craters per unit area can be used to estimate the age of the surface  the radiometric ages of impact-melted rocks collected during the apollo missions cluster between  and  years old this has been used to propose a late heavy bombardment period of increased impacts  blanketed on top of the moon crust is a highly comminuted broken into ever smaller particles and impact gardened surface layer called regolith  formed by impact processes the finer regolith the lunar soil of silicon dioxide glass has a texture resembling snow and a scent resembling spent gunpowder   the regolith of older surfaces is generally thicker than for younger surfaces it varies in thickness from  in the highlands and  in the maria  beneath the finely comminuted regolith layer is the  a layer of highly fractured bedrock many kilometers thick  high-resolution images from the lunar reconnaissance orbiter in the show a contemporary crater-production rate significantly higher than was previously estimated a secondary cratering process caused by distal ejecta is thought to churn the top two centimeters of regolith on a timescale of  years   this rate is times faster than the rate computed from models based solely on direct micrometeorite impacts  reiner gamma gravity of the moon grail the gravitational field of the moon has been measured through tracking the doppler shift of radio signals emitted by orbiting spacecraft the main lunar gravity features are mascons  large positive gravitational anomalies associated with some of the giant impact basins partly caused by the dense mare basaltic lava flows that fill those basins   the anomalies greatly influence the orbit of spacecraft about the moon there are some puzzles lava flows by themselves cannot explain all of the gravitational signature and some mascons exist that are not linked to mare volcanism  lunar swirls lunar swirls are enigmatic features found across the moon surface they are characterized by a high albedo appear optically immature ie the optical characteristics of a relatively young regolith and have often a sinuous shape their shape is often accentuated by low albedo regions that wind between the bright swirls they are located in places with enhanced surface magnetic fields and many are located at the antipodal point of major impacts well known swirls include the reiner gamma feature and mare ingenii  they are hypothesized to be areas that have been partially shielded from the solar wind  resulting in slower space weathering   lunar water liquid water cannot persist on the lunar surface when exposed to solar radiation water quickly decomposes through a process known as photodissociation and is lost to space however since the  scientists have hypothesized that water ice may be deposited by impacting comets or possibly produced by the reaction of oxygen-rich lunar rocks and hydrogen from solar wind  leaving traces of water which could possibly persist in cold permanently shadowed craters at either pole on the moon   computer simulations suggest that up to   of the surface may be in permanent shadow  the presence of usable quantities of water on the moon is an important factor in rendering lunar habitation as a cost-effective plan the alternative of transporting water from earth would be prohibitively expensive  in years since signatures of water have been found to exist on the lunar surface  in  the bistatic radar experiment located on the clementine spacecraft indicated the existence of small frozen pockets of water close to the surface however later radar observations by arecibo  suggest these findings may rather be rocks ejected from young impact craters  in  the neutron spectrometer on the spacecraft showed that high concentrations of hydrogen are present in the first meter of depth in the regolith near the polar regions  volcanic lava beads brought back to earth aboard apollo  showed small amounts of water in their interior  the chandrayaan- spacecraft has since confirmed the existence of surface water ice using the on-board moon mineralogy mapper  the spectrometer observed absorption lines common to hydroxyl  in reflected sunlight providing evidence of large quantities of water ice on the lunar surface the spacecraft showed that concentrations may possibly be as high as  ppm   using the mapper reflectance spectra indirect lighting of areas in shadow confirmed water ice within latitude of both poles in   in  lcross sent a   impactor into a permanently shadowed polar crater and detected at least  of water in a plume of ejected material   another examination of the lcross data showed the amount of detected water to be closer to   in may  ppm water in melt inclusions in lunar sample was reported  the famous high-titanium orange glass soil of volcanic origin collected during the apollo mission in  the inclusions were formed during explosive eruptions on the moon approximately  billion years ago this concentration is comparable with that of magma in earth upper mantle  although of considerable selenological interest this announcement affords little comfort to would-be lunar colonists the sample originated many kilometers below the surface and the inclusions are so difficult to access that it took years to find them with a state-of-the-art ion microprobe instrument analysis of the findings of the moon mineralogy mapper  revealed in august for the first time definitive evidence for water-ice on the lunar surface   the data revealed the distinct reflective signatures of water-ice as opposed to dust and other reflective substances  the ice deposits were found on the north and south poles although it is more abundant in the south where water is trapped in permanently shadowed craters and crevices allowing it to persist as ice on the surface since they are shielded from the sun   in october  astronomers reported detecting molecular water on the sunlit surface of the moon by several independent spacecraft including the stratospheric observatory for infrared astronomy sofia     the surface of the moon is an extreme environment with temperatures that range from down to  an atmospheric pressure of pa and high levels of ionizing radiation from the sun and cosmic rays  the exposed surfaces of spacecraft are considered unlikely to harbor bacterial spoors after just one lunar orbit  the surface gravity of the moon is approximately s  about  that on earth surface or    atmosphere of the moon ladee   the moon has an atmosphere so tenuous as to be nearly vacuum  with a total mass of less than tonnes  long tons short tons  the surface pressure of this small mass is around atm  npa  it varies with the lunar day its sources include outgassing and sputtering  a product of the bombardment of lunar soil by solar wind ions   elements that have been detected include sodium and potassium  produced by sputtering also found in the atmospheres of mercury and io  helium- and neon  from the solar wind and argon-  radon-  and polonium-  outgassed after their creation by radioactive decay within the crust and mantle   the absence of such neutral species atoms or molecules as oxygen  nitrogen  carbon  hydrogen and magnesium  which are present in the regolith  is not understood  water vapor has been detected by chandrayaan- and found to vary with latitude with a maximum at  it is possibly generated from the sublimation of water ice in the regolith  these gases either return into the regolith because of the moon gravity or are lost to space either through solar radiation pressure or if they are ionized by being swept away by the solar wind magnetic field  studies of moon magma samples retrieved by the apollo missions demonstrate that the moon had once possessed a relatively thick atmosphere for a period of million years between and billion years ago this atmosphere sourced from gases ejected from lunar volcanic eruptions was twice the thickness of that of present-day mars  the ancient lunar atmosphere was eventually stripped away by solar winds and dissipated into space  a permanent moon dust cloud exists around the moon generated by small particles from comets estimates are tons of comet particles strike the moon surface every hours resulting in the ejection of dust particles the dust stays above the moon approximately minutes taking minutes to rise and minutes to fall on average kilograms of dust are present above the moon rising up to kilometers above the surface dust counts made by ladee lunar dust experiment ldex found particle counts peaked during the geminid  quadrantid  northern taurid  and omicron centaurid meteor showers  when the earth and moon pass through comet debris the lunar dust cloud is asymmetric being more dense near the boundary between the moon dayside and nightside   satellite system

scale model of the earthmoon system sizes and distances are to scale orbit of the moon lunar theory because of tidal locking  the rotation of the moon around its own axis is synchronous to its orbital period around the earth the moon makes a complete orbit around earth with respect to the fixed stars about once every  g its sidereal period  however because earth is moving in its orbit around the sun at the same time it takes slightly longer for the moon to show the same phase to earth which is about  h its synodic period    unlike most satellites of other planets the moon orbits closer to the ecliptic plane than to the planet equatorial plane  the moon orbit is subtly perturbed by the sun and earth in many small complex and interacting ways for example the plane of the moon orbit gradually rotates once every  years  which affects other aspects of lunar motion these follow-on effects are mathematically described by cassini laws   the moon axial tilt with respect to the ecliptic is only    much less than the  of earth because of this the moon solar illumination varies much less with season and topographical details play a crucial role in seasonal effects  from images taken by clementine in  it appears that four mountainous regions on the rim of the crater peary at the moon north pole may remain illuminated for the entire lunar day  creating peaks of eternal light  no such regions exist at the south pole similarly there are places that remain in permanent shadow at the bottoms of many polar craters  and these  craters of eternal darkness  are extremely cold measured the lowest summer temperatures in craters at the southern pole at    and just   close to the winter solstice in the north polar crater hermite  this is the coldest temperature in the solar system ever measured by a spacecraft colder even than the surface of pluto   average temperatures of the moon surface are reported but temperatures of different areas will vary greatly depending upon whether they are in sunlight or shadow  dscovr satellite the moon is an exceptionally large natural satellite relative to earth its diameter is more than a quarter and its mass is  of earth  it is the largest moon in the solar system relative to the size of its planet i though charon is larger relative to the dwarf planet pluto at  pluto mass j  the earth and the moon barycentre  their common center of mass is located   about a quarter of earth radius beneath the earth surface the earth revolves around the earth-moon barycentre once a sidereal month with  the speed of the moon or about  metres  per second this motion is superimposed on the much larger revolution of the earth around the sun at a speed of about kilometres  per second the surface area of the moon is slightly less than the areas of north and south america combined lunar observation lunar phase moonlight earthlight astronomy the synchronous rotation of the moon as it orbits the earth results in it always keeping nearly the same face turned towards the planet however because of the effect of libration  about  of the moon surface can actually be seen from earth the side of the moon that faces earth is called the near side  and the opposite the far side  the far side is often inaccurately called the dark side but it is in fact illuminated as often as the near side once every  earth days during new moon  the near side is dark  the moon originally rotated at a faster rate but early in its history its rotation slowed and became tidally locked in this orientation as a result of frictional effects associated with tidal deformations caused by earth  with time the energy of rotation of the moon on its axis was dissipated as heat until there was no rotation of the moon relative to earth in  planetary scientists using data collected on the - nasa lunar prospector mission found two hydrogen-rich areas most likely former water ice on opposite sides of the moon it is speculated that these patches were the poles of the moon billions of years ago before it was tidally locked to earth  lunar phases earth the moon has an exceptionally low albedo  giving it a reflectance that is slightly brighter than that of worn asphalt  despite this it is the brightest object in the sky after the sun   k this is due partly to the brightness enhancement of the opposition surge  the moon at quarter phase is only one-tenth as bright rather than half as bright as at full moon   additionally color constancy in the visual system recalibrates the relations between the colors of an object and its surroundings and because the surrounding sky is comparatively dark the sunlit moon is perceived as a bright object the edges of the full moon seem as bright as the center without limb darkening  because of the reflective properties of lunar soil  which retroreflects light more towards the sun than in other directions the moon does appear larger when close to the horizon but this is a purely psychological effect known as the moon illusion  first described in the century bc  the full moon angular diameter is about  on average in the sky roughly the same apparent size as the sun see eclipses  the moon highest altitude at culmination varies by its phase and time of year the full moon is highest in the sky during winter for each hemisphere the orientation of the moon crescent also depends on the latitude of the viewing location an observer in the tropics can see a smile-shaped crescent moon  the moon is visible for two weeks every  days at the north and south poles  zooplankton in the arctic use moonlight when the sun is below the horizon for months on end  high desert full moon supermoon lunar eclipse january lunar eclipse the distance between the moon and earth varies from around   to   at perigee closest and apogee farthest respectively on november  it was closer to earth when at full phase than it has been since   closer than its farthest position in apogee  reported as a  supermoon  this closest point coincided within an hour of a full moon and it was  more luminous than when at its greatest distance because its angular diameter is  greater and     at lower levels the human perception of reduced brightness as a percentage is provided by the following formula   when the actual reduction is    or about  the perceived reduction is about  or    this gives a maximum perceived increase of  between apogee and perigee moons of the same phase  there has been historical controversy over whether features on the moon surface change over time today many of these claims are thought to be illusory resulting from observation under different lighting conditions poor astronomical seeing  or inadequate drawings however outgassing does occasionally occur and could be responsible for a minor percentage of the reported lunar transient phenomena  recently it has been suggested that a roughly  diameter region of the lunar surface was modified by a gas release event about a million years ago   the moon appearance like the sun can be affected by earth atmosphere  common optical effects are the halo ring  formed when the moon light is refracted through the ice crystals of high cirrostratus clouds and smaller coronal rings when the moon is seen through thin clouds  phases of the moon northern hemisphere earthmoon distance the illuminated area of the visible sphere degree of illumination is given by  where is the elongation ie the angle between moon the observer on earth and the sun solar eclipse lunar eclipse eclipse cycle lunar eclipse solar eclipse stereo-b  eclipses only occur when the sun earth and moon are all in a straight line termed  syzygy  solar eclipses occur at new moon  when the moon is between the sun and earth in contrast lunar eclipses occur at full moon when earth is between the sun and moon the apparent size of the moon is roughly the same as that of the sun with both being viewed at close to one-half a degree wide the sun is much larger than the moon but it is the vastly greater distance that gives it the same apparent size as the much closer and much smaller moon from the perspective of earth the variations in apparent size due to the non-circular orbits are nearly the same as well though occurring in different cycles this makes possible both total with the moon appearing larger than the sun and annular with the moon appearing smaller than the sun solar eclipses  in a total eclipse the moon completely covers the disc of the sun and the solar corona becomes visible to the naked eye  because the distance between the moon and earth is very slowly increasing over time  the angular diameter of the moon is decreasing also as it evolves toward becoming a red giant  the size of the sun and its apparent diameter in the sky are slowly increasing l the combination of these two changes means that hundreds of millions of years ago the moon would always completely cover the sun on solar eclipses and no annular eclipses were possible likewise hundreds of millions of years in the future the moon will no longer cover the sun completely and total solar eclipses will not occur  because the moon orbit around earth is inclined by about    to the orbit of earth around the sun  eclipses do not occur at every full and new moon for an eclipse to occur the moon must be near the intersection of the two orbital planes  the periodicity and recurrence of eclipses of the sun by the moon and of the moon by earth is described by the saros  which has a period of approximately   because the moon continuously blocks the view of a half-degree-wide circular area of the sky m  the related phenomenon of occultation occurs when a bright star or planet passes behind the moon and is occulted hidden from view in this way a solar eclipse is an occultation of the sun because the moon is comparatively close to earth occultations of individual stars are not visible everywhere on the planet nor at the same time because of the precession of the lunar orbit each year different stars are occulted  tidal force tidal acceleration tide theory of tides libration the gravitational attraction that masses have for one another decreases inversely with the square of the distance of those masses from each other as a result the slightly greater attraction that the moon has for the side of earth closest to the moon as compared to the part of the earth opposite the moon results in tidal forces  tidal forces affect both the earth crust and oceans the most obvious effect of tidal forces is to cause two bulges in the earth oceans one on the side facing the moon and the other on the side opposite this results in elevated sea levels called ocean tides   as the earth rotates on its axis one of the ocean bulges high tide is held in place under the moon while another such tide is opposite as a result there are two high tides and two low tides in about hours  since the moon is orbiting the earth in the same direction of the earth rotation the high tides occur about every hours and minutes the minutes is due to the moon time to orbit the earth the sun has the same tidal effect on the earth but its forces of attraction are only  that of the moon the sun and moon interplay is responsible for spring and neap tides   if the earth were a water world one with no continents it would produce a tide of only one meter and that tide would be very predictable but the ocean tides are greatly modified by other effects the frictional coupling of water to earth rotation through the ocean floors the inertia of water movement ocean basins that grow shallower near land the sloshing of water between different ocean basins  as a result the timing of the tides at most points on the earth is a product of observations that are explained incidentally by theory while gravitation causes acceleration and movement of the earth fluid oceans gravitational coupling between the moon and earth solid body is mostly elastic and plastic the result is a further tidal effect of the moon on the earth that causes a bulge of the solid portion of the earth nearest the moon delays in the tidal peaks of both ocean and solid-body tides cause torque in opposition to the earth rotation this drains angular momentum and rotational kinetic energy from earth rotation slowing the earth rotation   that angular momentum lost from the earth is transferred to the moon in a process confusingly known as tidal acceleration  which lifts the moon into a higher orbit and results in its lower orbital speed about the earth thus the distance between earth and moon is increasing  and the earth rotation is slowing in reaction  measurements from laser reflectors left during the apollo missions  lunar ranging experiments  have found that the moon distance increases by  per year roughly the rate at which human fingernails grow    atomic clocks also show that earth day lengthens by about microseconds every year    slowly increasing the rate at which utc is adjusted by leap seconds 
this tidal drag would continue until the rotation of earth and the orbital period of the moon matched creating mutual tidal locking between the two and suspending the moon over one meridian this is currently the case with pluto and its moon charon however the sun will become a red giant engulfing the earth-moon system long before this occurrence   in a like manner the lunar surface experiences tides of around  amplitude over  with three components a fixed one due to earth because they are in synchronous rotation  a variable tide due to orbital eccentricity and inclination and a small varying component from the sun  the earth-induced variable component arises from changing distance and libration  a result of the moon orbital eccentricity and inclination if the moon orbit were perfectly circular and un-inclined there would only be solar tides  libration also changes the angle from which the moon is seen allowing a total of about  of its surface to be seen from earth over time  the cumulative effects of stress built up by these tidal forces produces moonquakes  moonquakes are much less common and weaker than are earthquakes although moonquakes can last for up to an hour significantly longer than terrestrial quakes because of scattering of the seismic vibrations in the dry fragmented upper crust the existence of moonquakes was an unexpected discovery from seismometers placed on the moon by apollo astronauts from through   according to recent re scientists suggest that the moon influence on the earth may contribute to maintaining earth magnetic field

johannes hevelius selenographia libration one of the earliest-discovered possible depictions of the moon is a -year-old rock carving orthostat at knowth  ireland   understanding of the moon cycles was an early development of astronomy by the  babylonian astronomers had recorded the -year saros cycle of lunar eclipses   and indian astronomers had described the moon monthly elongation  the chinese astronomer shi shen gave instructions for predicting solar and lunar eclipses  later the physical form of the moon and the cause of moonlight became understood the ancient greek philosopher anaxagoras reasoned that the sun and moon were both giant spherical rocks and that the latter reflected the light of the former   although the chinese of the han dynasty believed the moon to be energy equated to qi  their influence theory also recognized that the light of the moon was merely a reflection of the sun and jing fang  noted the sphericity of the moon  in the century ad lucian wrote the novel a true story  in which the heroes travel to the moon and meet its inhabitants in  the indian astronomer aryabhata mentioned in his aryabhatiya that reflected sunlight is the cause of the shining of the moon  the astronomer and physicist alhazen  found that sunlight was not reflected from the moon like a mirror but that light was emitted from every part of the moon sunlit surface in all directions  shen kuo  of the song dynasty created an allegory equating the waxing and waning of the moon to a round ball of reflective silver that when doused with white powder and viewed from the side would appear to be a crescent  galileo sidereus nuncius in aristotle  description of the universe  the moon marked the boundary between the spheres of the mutable elements earth water air and fire and the imperishable stars of aether  an influential philosophy that would dominate for centuries  however in the  seleucus of seleucia correctly theorized that tides were due to the attraction of the moon and that their height depends on the moon position relative to the sun   in the same century aristarchus computed the size and distance of the moon from earth obtaining a value of about twenty times the radius of earth for the distance these figures were greatly improved by ptolemy  his values of a mean distance of earth radius and a diameter of  diameters were close to the correct values of about and  respectively  archimedes  bc designed a planetarium that could calculate the motions of the moon and other objects in the solar system  during the middle ages  before the invention of the telescope the moon was increasingly recognised as a sphere though many believed that it was perfectly smooth  in  galileo galilei used an early telescope to make drawings of the moon for his book sidereus nuncius  and deduced that it was not smooth but had mountains and craters thomas harriot had made but not published such drawings a few months earlier telescopic mapping of the moon followed later in the century the efforts of giovanni battista riccioli and francesco maria grimaldi led to the system of naming of lunar features in use today the more exact of wilhelm beer and johann heinrich mdler  and their associated book  the first trigonometrically accurate study of lunar features included the heights of more than a thousand mountains and introduced the study of the moon at accuracies possible in earthly geography  lunar craters first noted by galileo were thought to be volcanic until the proposal of richard proctor that they were formed by collisions  this view gained support in from the experimentation of geologist grove karl gilbert  and from comparative studies from to the   leading to the development of lunar stratigraphy  which by the was becoming a new and growing branch of astrogeology   space race moon landing between the first human arrival with the robotic soviet program in  to the with the last missions of the crewed us apollo landings and last

during the late at the height of the cold war the united states army conducted a classified feasibility study that proposed the construction of a staffed military outpost on the moon called project horizon with the potential to conduct a wide range of missions from scientific re to nuclear earth bombardment the study included the possibility of conducting a lunar-based nuclear test   the air force which at the time was in competition with the army for a leading role in the space program developed its own similar plan called lunex     however both these proposals were ultimately passed over as the space program was largely transferred from the military to the civilian agency nasa  following president john f kennedy commitment to a manned moon landing before the end of the decade the united states under nasa leadership launched a series of uncrewed probes to develop an understanding of the lunar surface in preparation for human missions the jet propulsion laboratory ranger program

topographic map of the moon and the first global multispectral images of the lunar surface  this was followed in by the lunar prospector mission whose instruments indicated the presence of excess

including humans the moon has long been particularly associated with insanity and irrationality the words and lunatic popular shortening  are derived from the latin name for the moon  philosophers aristotle and pliny the elder argued that the full moon induced insanity in susceptible individuals believing that the brain which is mostly water must be affected by the moon and its power over the tides but the moon gravity is too slight to affect any single person  even today people who believe in a lunar effect claim that admissions to psychiatric hospitals traffic accidents homicides or suicides increase during a full moon but dozens of studies invalidate these claims       equator   near-earth asteroids cruithne co-orbital quasi-satellites other moons of earth  new moon earthshine

carries the name of the roman god of war and is often referred to as the  red planet    the latter refers to the effect of the iron oxide prevalent on mars surface which gives it a reddish appearance distinctive among the astronomical bodies visible to the naked eye  mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere  with surface features reminiscent of the impact craters of the moon and the valleys deserts and polar ice caps of earth  the days and seasons are comparable to those of earth because the rotational period as well as the tilt of the rotational axis relative to the ecliptic plane are similar mars is the site of olympus mons  the largest volcano and highest known mountain on any planet in the solar system and of valles marineris  one of the largest canyons in the solar system the smooth borealis basin in the northern hemisphere covers  of the planet and may be a giant impact feature   mars has two moons  phobos and deimos  which are small and irregularly shaped these may be captured asteroids  similar to eureka  a mars trojan    mars has been explored by several uncrewed spacecraft mariner was the first spacecraft to visit mars launched by nasa on november  it made its closest approach to the planet on july  detected the weak martian radiation belt measured at about  that of earth and captured the first images of another planet from deep space  the soviet mars mission included a lander  which achieved a soft landing in december  however contact was lost seconds after touchdown  on july  viking performed the first successful landing on the martian surface  on july  the mars pathfinder spacecraft landed on mars and on july released its rover  sojourner  the first robotic rover to operate on mars  the mars express orbiter the first european space agency esa spacecraft to visit mars arrived in orbit on december   in january  nasa mars exploration rovers  named spirit and opportunity  both landed on mars operated until march and lasted until june   nasa landed its curiosity rover on august   as a part of its mars science laboratory msl mission to investigate martian climate and geology  on september  the indian space re organisation isro became the fourth space agency to visit mars when its maiden interplanetary mission the mars orbiter mission spacecraft arrived in orbit  the united arab emirates became the fifth to successfully undertake a mission to mars  having inserted an orbiter into the martian atmosphere on february   china national space administration cnsa tianwen- spacecraft arrived in martian orbit on february   nasa rover and helicopter successfully landed on mars on february   successfully completed the first powered controlled flight by an aircraft on any planet besides earth on april  taking off vertically  hovering and landing on mars   on may  cnsa lander and rover successfully landed on mars  rover was successfully deployed on may  which makes china the second country to successfully deploy a rover on mars after the united states  there are investigations assessing the past habitability of mars as well as the possibility of extant life  astrobiology missions are planned such as the european space agency rosalind franklin rover     liquid water on the surface of mars cannot exist due to low atmospheric pressure which is less than  of the atmospheric pressure on earth except at the lowest elevations for short periods    the two polar ice caps appear to be made largely of water   the volume of water ice in the south polar ice cap if melted would be sufficient to cover the planetary surface to a depth of metres   in november  nasa reported finding a large amount of underground ice in the utopia planitia region the volume of water detected has been estimated to be equivalent to the volume of water in lake superior     mars can easily be seen from earth with the naked eye as can its reddish coloring its apparent magnitude reaches  which is surpassed only by venus  the moon and the sun   optical ground-based telescopes are typically limited to resolving features about kilometres  across when earth and mars are closest because of earth atmosphere  contents in english the planet is named after the roman god of war  an association made because of its red color which suggests blood  the adjectival form of latin is   which provides the english words martian  used as an adjective or for a putative inhabitant of mars and  used as an adjective corresponding to for earth  in greek the planet is known as  with the inflectional stem   from this come technical terms such as areology  as well as the adjective  and the star name antares  is also the basis of the name of the month of march from latin of mars  as well as of tuesday latin of mars where the old anglo-saxon god tw was identified with roman god mars by interpretatio germanica   due to the global influence of european languages in astronomy  a word like or for the planet is common around the world though it may be used alongside older native words a number of other languages have provided words with international usage for example arabic persian urdu malay swahili  chinese five elements korean japanese vietnamese  sanskrit mangal mangala  hebrew     mars is approximately half the diameter of earth with a surface area only slightly less than the total area of earth dry land  mars is less dense than earth having about  of earth volume and  of earth mass  resulting in about  of earth surface gravity the red-orange appearance of the martian surface is caused by ironiii oxide  or rust  it can look like butterscotch  other common surface colors include golden brown tan and greenish depending on the minerals present  earth animation  video  like earth mars has differentiated into a dense metallic core overlaid by less dense materials  scientists initially determined that the core is at least partially liquid  current models of its interior imply a core with a radius of about  kilometres  consisting primarily of iron and nickel with about  sulfur   this ironii sulfide core is thought to be twice as rich in lighter elements as earth  the core is surrounded by a silicate mantle that formed many of the tectonic and volcanic features on the planet but it appears to be dormant besides silicon and oxygen the most abundant elements in the martian crust are iron  magnesium  aluminium  calcium  and potassium  the average thickness of the planet crust is about kilometres  with a maximum thickness of kilometres   earth crust averages kilometres  mars is seismically active with insight recording over marsquakes and related events in    in march  nasa reported based on measurements of over marsquakes by the lander on the planet mars that the core of mars is between  and   and  about half the size of the core of earth  and significantly smaller suggesting a core of lighter elements than thought earlier  geology of mars mars is a terrestrial planet whose surface consists of minerals containing silicon and oxygen  metals  and other elements that typically make up rock  the martian surface is primarily composed of tholeiitic basalt   although parts are more silica -rich than typical basalt and may be similar to andesitic rocks on earth or silica glass regions of low albedo suggest concentrations of plagioclase feldspar  with northern low albedo regions displaying higher than normal concentrations of sheet silicates and high-silicon glass parts of the southern highlands include detectable amounts of high-calcium pyroxenes  localized concentrations of hematite and olivine have been found  much of the surface is deeply covered by finely grained ironiii oxide dust   geologic map usgs  although mars has no evidence of a structured global magnetic field   observations show that parts of the planet crust have been magnetized suggesting that alternating polarity reversals of its dipole field have occurred in the past this paleomagnetism of magnetically susceptible minerals is similar to the alternating bands found on earth ocean floors  one theory published in and re-examined in with the help of the mars global surveyor  is that these bands suggest plate tectonic activity on mars four billion years ago before the planetary dynamo ceased to function and the planet magnetic field faded  it is thought that during the solar system formation  mars was created as the result of a stochastic process of run-away accretion of material from the protoplanetary disk that orbited the sun mars has many distinctive chemical features caused by its position in the solar system elements with comparatively low boiling points such as chlorine  phosphorus  and sulphur  are much more common on mars than earth these elements were probably pushed outward by the young sun energetic solar wind   after the formation of the planets all were subjected to the so-called  late heavy bombardment  about  of the surface of mars shows a record of impacts from that era    whereas much of the remaining surface is probably underlain by immense impact basins caused by those events there is evidence of an enormous impact basin in the northern hemisphere of mars spanning  by  kilometres  by  or roughly four times the size of the moon south pole aitken basin  the largest impact basin yet discovered   this theory suggests that mars was struck by a pluto -sized body about four billion years ago the event thought to be the cause of the martian hemispheric dichotomy  created the smooth borealis basin that covers  of the planet    the geological history of mars can be split into many periods but the following are the three primary periods   noachian period noachis terra tharsis hesperian period hesperia planum amazonian period amazonis planitia meteorite impact olympus mons geological activity is still taking place on mars the athabasca valles is home to sheet-like lava flows created about mya  water flows in the grabens called the cerberus fossae occurred less than  indicating equally recent volcanic intrusions  on  images from the mars reconnaissance orbiter showed evidence of an avalanche from a -metre-high  cliff  martian soil spirit the phoenix lander returned data showing martian soil to be slightly alkaline and containing elements such as magnesium  sodium  potassium and chlorine  these nutrients are found in soils on earth and they are necessary for growth of plants  experiments performed by the lander showed that the martian soil has a basic ph of  and contains  of the salt perchlorate      concentrations that are toxic to humans    streaks are common across mars and new ones appear frequently on steep slopes of craters troughs and valleys the streaks are dark at first and get lighter with age the streaks can start in a tiny area then spread out for hundreds of metres they have been seen to follow the edges of boulders and other obstacles in their path the commonly accepted theories include that they are dark underlying layers of soil revealed after avalanches of bright dust or dust devils   several other explanations have been put forward including those that involve water or even the growth of organisms   water on mars liquid water cannot exist on the surface of mars due to low atmospheric pressure which is less than  that of earth  except at the lowest elevations for short periods   the two polar ice caps appear to be made largely of water   the volume of water ice in the south polar ice cap if melted would be sufficient to cover the entire planetary surface to a depth of metres   a permafrost mantle stretches from the pole to latitudes of about   large quantities of ice are thought to be trapped within the thick cryosphere of mars radar data from mars express and the mars reconnaissance orbiter mro show large quantities of ice at both poles july    and at middle latitudes november   the phoenix lander directly sampled water ice in shallow martian soil on july   opportunity hematite concretion landforms visible on mars strongly suggest that liquid water has existed on the planet surface huge linear swathes of scoured ground known as outflow channels  cut across the surface in about places these are thought to be a record of erosion caused by the catastrophic release of water from subsurface aquifers though some of these structures have been hypothesized to result from the action of glaciers or lava   one of the larger examples ma vallis  is kilometres  long much greater than the grand canyon with a width of kilometres  and a depth of kilometres  in places it is thought to have been carved by flowing water early in mars history  the youngest of these channels are thought to have formed as recently as only a few million years ago  elsewhere particularly on the oldest areas of the martian surface finer-scale dendritic networks of valleys are spread across significant proportions of the landscape features of these valleys and their distribution strongly imply that they were carved by runoff resulting from precipitation in early mars history subsurface water flow and groundwater sapping may play important subsidiary roles in some networks but precipitation was probably the root cause of the incision in almost all cases  along crater and canyon walls there are thousands of features that appear similar to terrestrial gullies  the gullies tend to be in the highlands of the southern hemisphere and to face the equator all are poleward of latitude a number of authors have suggested that their formation process involves liquid water probably from melting ice   although others have argued for formation mechanisms involving carbon dioxide frost or the movement of dry dust   no partially degraded gullies have formed by weathering and no superimposed impact craters have been observed indicating that these are young features possibly still active  other geological features such as deltas and alluvial fans preserved in craters are further evidence for warmer wetter conditions at an interval or intervals in earlier mars history  such conditions necessarily require the widespread presence of crater lakes across a large proportion of the surface for which there is independent mineralogical sedimentological and geomorphological evidence  mro   further evidence that liquid water once existed on the surface of mars comes from the detection of specific minerals such as hematite and goethite  both of which sometimes form in the presence of water  in  detected the mineral jarosite  this forms only in the presence of acidic water which demonstrates that water once existed on mars  more recent evidence for liquid water comes from the finding of the mineral gypsum on the surface by nasa mars rover opportunity in december    it is estimated that the amount of water in the upper mantle of mars represented by hydroxyl ions contained within the minerals of mars geology is equal to or greater than that of earth at parts per million of water which is enough to cover the entire planet to a depth of  metres   in  radar data revealed the presence of large quantities of water ice at the poles  and at mid-latitudes   the mars rover spirit sampled chemical compounds containing water molecules in march  on march  nasa reported evidence from instruments on the rover of mineral hydration  likely hydrated calcium sulfate  in several rock samples including the broken fragments of tintina rock and sutton inlier rock as well as in veins and nodules in other rocks like knorr rock and wernicke rock     analysis using the rover dan instrument provided evidence of subsurface water amounting to as much as  water content down to a depth of centimetres  during the rover traverse from the bradbury landing site to the area in the glenelg terrain  in september  nasa announced that they had found conclusive evidence of hydrated brine flows on recurring slope lineae  based on spectrometer readings of the darkened areas of slopes    these observations provided confirmation of earlier hypotheses based on timing of formation and their rate of growth that these dark streaks resulted from water flowing in the very shallow subsurface  the streaks contain hydrated salts perchlorates which have water molecules in their crystal structure  the streaks flow downhill in martian summer when the temperature is above celsius and freeze at lower temperatures  water ice esa mars express reers suspect that much of the low northern plains of the planet were covered with an ocean hundreds of meters deep though this remains controversial  in march  scientists stated that such an ocean might have been the size of earth arctic ocean  this finding was derived from the ratio of water to deuterium in the modern martian atmosphere compared to that ratio on earth the amount of martian deuterium is eight times the amount that exists on earth suggesting that ancient mars had significantly higher levels of water results from the rover had previously found a high ratio of deuterium in gale crater  though not significantly high enough to suggest the former presence of an ocean other scientists caution that these results have not been confirmed and point out that martian climate models have not yet shown that the planet was warm enough in the past to support bodies of liquid water  near the northern polar cap is the  kilometres  wide korolev crater  where the mars express orbiter found it to be filled with approximately  cubic kilometres  of water ice  the crater floor lies about kilometres  below the rim and is covered by a  kilometres  deep central mound of permanent water ice up to kilometres  in diameter   in february  it was found that dark streaks called recurring slope lineae rsl which appear seasonably are caused by briny water flowing for a few days annually   martian polar ice caps  mars has two permanent polar ice caps during a pole winter it lies in continuous darkness chilling the surface and causing the deposition of  of the atmosphere into slabs of co ice  dry ice   when the poles are again exposed to sunlight the frozen co sublimes  these seasonal actions transport large amounts of dust and water vapor giving rise to earth-like frost and large cirrus clouds  clouds of water-ice were photographed by the opportunity rover in   the caps at both poles consist primarily  of water ice frozen carbon dioxide accumulates as a comparatively thin layer about one metre thick on the north cap in the northern winter only whereas the south cap has a permanent dry ice cover about eight metres thick this permanent dry ice cover at the south pole is peppered by flat floored shallow roughly circular pits  which repeat imaging shows are expanding by meters per year this suggests that the permanent co cover over the south pole water ice is degrading over time  the northern polar cap has a diameter of about  kilometres  during the northern mars summer  and contains about  cubic kilometres  cuft of ice which if spread evenly on the cap would be kilometres  thick  this compares to a volume of  cubic kilometres  cuft for the greenland ice sheet  the southern polar cap has a diameter of kilometres  and a thickness of kilometres   the total volume of ice in the south polar cap plus the adjacent layered deposits has been estimated at  cubic km  both polar caps show spiral troughs which recent analysis of sharad ice penetrating radar has shown are a result of katabatic winds that spiral due to the coriolis effect    the seasonal frosting of areas near the southern ice cap results in the formation of transparent -metre-thick slabs of dry ice above the ground with the arrival of spring sunlight warms the subsurface and pressure from subliming co builds up under a slab elevating and ultimately rupturing it this leads to geyser-like eruptions of co gas mixed with dark basaltic sand or dust this process is rapid observed happening in the space of a few days weeks or months a rate of change rather unusual in geology especially for mars the gas rushing underneath a slab to the site of a geyser carves a spiderweb-like pattern of radial channels under the ice the process being the inverted equivalent of an erosion network formed by water draining through a single plughole     mola geography of mars areoid categorysurface features of mars although better remembered for mapping the moon johann heinrich mdler and wilhelm beer were the first areographers they began by establishing that most of mars surface features were permanent and by more precisely determining the planet rotation period in  mdler combined ten years of observations and drew the first map of mars rather than giving names to the various markings beer and mdler simply designated them with letters meridian bay sinus meridiani was thus feature    today features on mars are named from a variety of sources albedo features are named for classical mythology craters larger than are named for deceased scientists and writers and others who have contributed to the study of mars craters smaller than are named for towns and villages of the world with populations of less than  large valleys are named for the word mars or star in various languages small valleys are named for rivers  large albedo features retain many of the older names but are often updated to reflect new knowledge of the nature of the features for example nix olympica the snows of olympus has become olympus mons mount olympus  the surface of mars as seen from earth is divided into two kinds of areas with differing albedo the paler plains covered with dust and sand rich in reddish iron oxides were once thought of as martian continents and given names like arabia terra   or amazonis planitia   the dark features were thought to be seas hence their names mare erythraeum  mare sirenum and aurorae sinus  the largest dark feature seen from earth is syrtis major planum   the permanent northern polar ice cap is named planum boreum  whereas the southern cap is called planum australe  mars equator is defined by its rotation but the location of its prime meridian was specified as was earth at greenwich  by choice of an arbitrary point mdler and beer selected a line for their first maps of mars in  after the spacecraft mariner provided extensive imagery of mars in  a small crater later called airy-  located in the sinus meridiani middle bay or meridian bay was chosen by merton davies of the rand corporation  for the definition of  longitude to coincide with the original selection  because mars has no oceans and hence no  sea level  a zero-elevation surface had to be selected as a reference level this is called the areoid  of mars analogous to the terrestrial geoid   zero altitude was defined by the height at which there is  pa  mbar  of atmospheric pressure  this pressure corresponds to the triple point of water and it is about  of the sea level surface pressure on earth  atm  list of quadrangles on mars for mapping purposes the united states geological survey divides the surface of mars into thirty cartographic

usgs    equator mars global surveyor the dichotomy of martian topography is striking northern plains flattened by lava flows contrast with the southern highlands pitted and cratered by ancient impacts re in has presented evidence regarding a theory proposed in postulating that four billion years ago the northern hemisphere of mars was struck by an object one-tenth to two-thirds the size of earth moon  if validated this would make the northern hemisphere of mars the site of an impact crater  by  kilometres  by  in size or roughly the area of europe asia and australia combined surpassing the south poleaitken basin as the largest impact crater in the solar system   asteroid mro  mars is scarred by a number of impact craters a total of  craters with a diameter of kilometres  or greater have been found  the largest confirmed of these is the hellas impact basin  a light albedo feature clearly visible from earth  due to the smaller mass and size of mars the probability of an object colliding with the planet is about half that of earth mars is located closer to the asteroid belt  so it has an increased chance of being struck by materials from that source mars is more likely to be struck by short-period comets   those that lie within the orbit of jupiter   in spite of this there are far fewer craters on mars compared with the moon because the atmosphere of mars provides protection against small meteors and surface modifying processes have erased some craters martian craters can have a morphology that suggests the ground became wet after the meteor impacted  viking olympus mons volcanology of mars the shield volcano olympus mons   is an extinct volcano in the vast upland region tharsis  which contains several other large volcanoes olympus mons is roughly three times the height of mount everest  which in comparison stands at just over  kilometres   it is either the tallest or second-tallest mountain in the solar system depending on how it is measured with various sources giving figures ranging from about to kilometres  to  high   valles marineris mars odyssey the large canyon valles marineris latin for  mariner valleys also known as agathadaemon in the old canal maps has a length of  kilometres  and a depth of up to kilometres  the length of valles marineris is equivalent to the length of europe and extends across one-fifth the circumference of mars by comparison the grand canyon on earth is only kilometres  long and nearly kilometres  deep valles marineris was formed due to the swelling of the tharsis area which caused the crust in the area of valles marineris to collapse in  it was proposed that valles marineris is not just a graben  but a plate boundary where kilometres  of transverse motion has occurred making mars a planet with possibly a two- tectonic plate arrangement   images from the thermal emission imaging system themis aboard nasa mars odyssey orbiter have revealed seven possible cave entrances on the flanks of the volcano arsia mons   the caves named after loved ones of their discoverers are collectively known as the seven sisters  cave entrances measure from to metres  to  wide and they are estimated to be at least to metres  to  deep because light does not reach the floor of most of the caves it is possible that they extend much deeper than these lower estimates and widen below the surface dena is the only exception its floor is visible and was measured to be metres  deep the interiors of these caverns may be protected from micrometeoroids uv radiation solar flares and high energy particles that bombard the planet surface  atmosphere of mars atmosphere of mars mars lost its magnetosphere years ago  possibly because of numerous asteroid strikes  so the solar wind interacts directly with the martian ionosphere  lowering the atmospheric density by stripping away atoms from the outer layer both mars global surveyor and mars express have detected ionised atmospheric particles trailing off into space behind mars   and this atmospheric loss is being studied by the maven orbiter compared to earth the atmosphere of mars is quite rarefied atmospheric pressure on the surface today ranges from a low of pa  psi  on olympus mons to over   in hellas planitia  with a mean pressure at the surface level of   the highest atmospheric density on mars is equal to that found kilometres   above earth surface the resulting mean surface pressure is only  of that of earth   the scale height of the atmosphere is about  kilometres   which is higher than earth kilometres  because the surface gravity of mars is only about  of earth an effect offset by both the lower temperature and  higher average molecular weight of the atmosphere of mars the atmosphere of mars consists of about  carbon dioxide   argon and  nitrogen along with traces of oxygen and water   the atmosphere is quite dusty containing particulates about  m in diameter which give the martian sky a tawny color when seen from the surface  it may take on a pink hue due to iron oxide particles suspended in it  methane on mars methane methane has been detected in the martian atmosphere    it occurs in extended plumes and the profiles imply that the methane is released from discrete regions the concentration of methane fluctuates from about  ppb during the northern winter to about  ppb during the summer  estimates of its lifetime range from  to years   so its presence indicates that an active source of the gas must be present methane could be produced by non-biological process such as serpentinization involving water carbon dioxide and the mineral olivine  which is known to be common on mars  methanogenic microbial life forms in the subsurface are among possible sources but even if rover missions determine that microscopic martian life is the source of the methane the life forms likely reside far below the surface outside of the rover reach  escaping atmosphere carbon oxygen hydrogen maven uv  in  the european space agency mars express found an ultraviolet glow coming from magnetic umbrellas in the southern hemisphere mars does not have a global magnetic field which guides charged particles entering the atmosphere mars has multiple umbrella-shaped magnetic fields mainly in the southern hemisphere which are remnants of a global field that decayed billions of years ago in late december  nasa maven spacecraft detected evidence of widespread auroras in mars northern hemisphere and descended to approximately north latitude of mars equator the particles causing the aurora penetrated into the martian atmosphere creating auroras below above the surface earth auroras range from to above the surface magnetic fields in the solar wind drape over mars into the atmosphere and the charged particles follow the solar wind magnetic field lines into the atmosphere causing auroras to occur outside the magnetic umbrellas  on march  nasa reported the detection of an aurora that is not fully understood and an unexplained dust cloud in the atmosphere of mars   in september  nasa reported radiation levels on the surface of the planet mars were temporarily doubled  and were associated with an aurora times brighter than any observed earlier due to a massive and unexpected solar storm in the middle of the month  climate of mars of all the planets in the solar system the seasons of mars are the most earth-like due to the similar tilts of the two planets rotational axes the lengths of the martian seasons are about twice those of earth because mars greater distance from the sun leads to the martian year being about two earth years long martian surface temperatures vary from lows of about  at the winter polar caps  to highs of up to  in equatorial summer  the wide range in temperatures is due to the thin atmosphere which cannot store much solar heat the low atmospheric pressure and the low thermal inertia of martian soil  the planet is  times as far from the sun as earth resulting in just  of the amount of sunlight  if mars had an earth-like orbit its seasons would be similar to earth because its axial tilt is similar to earth the comparatively large eccentricity of the martian orbit has a significant effect mars is near perihelion when it is summer in the southern hemisphere and winter in the north and near aphelion when it is winter in the southern hemisphere and summer in the north as a result the seasons in the southern hemisphere are more extreme and the seasons in the northern are milder than would otherwise be the case the summer temperatures in the south can be warmer than the equivalent summer temperatures in the north by up to   mars has the largest dust storms in the solar system reaching speeds of over h  these can vary from a storm over a small area to gigantic storms that cover the entire planet they tend to occur when mars is closest to the sun and have been shown to increase the global temperature  dust storms june  opportunity curiosity orbit of mars timekeeping on mars mars average distance from the sun is roughly  and its orbital period is earth days the solar day or sol  on mars is only slightly longer than an earth day hours minutes and  seconds  a martian year is equal to  earth years or year days and  hours  the axial tilt of mars is  relative to its orbital plane  which is similar to the axial tilt of earth  as a result mars has seasons like earth though on mars they are nearly twice as long because its orbital period is that much longer in the present day epoch the orientation of the north pole of mars is close to the star deneb   mars has a relatively pronounced orbital eccentricity of about  of the seven other planets in the solar system only mercury has a larger orbital eccentricity it is known that in the past mars has had a much more circular orbit at one point  earth years ago mars had an eccentricity of roughly  much less than that of earth today  mars cycle of eccentricity is  earth years compared to earth cycle of  years  mars has a much longer cycle of eccentricity with a period of  earth years and this overshadows the -year cycle in the eccentricity graphs for the last  years the orbit of mars has been getting slightly more eccentric because of the gravitational effects of the other planets the closest distance between earth and mars will continue to mildly decrease for the next  years  life on mars viking chryse planitia the current understanding of planetary habitability the ability of a world to develop environmental conditions favorable to the emergence of life favors planets that have liquid water on their surface most often this requires the orbit of a planet to lie within the habitable zone  which for the sun extends from just beyond venus to about the semi-major axis of mars  during perihelion mars dips inside this region but mars thin low-pressure atmosphere prevents liquid water from existing over large regions for extended periods the past flow of liquid water demonstrates the planet potential for habitability recent evidence has suggested that any water on the martian surface may have been too salty and acidic to support regular terrestrial life  impact glass alga crater ancient life  the lack of a magnetosphere and the extremely thin atmosphere of mars are a challenge the planet has little heat transfer across its surface poor insulation against bombardment of the solar wind and insufficient atmospheric pressure to retain water in a liquid form water instead sublimes to a gaseous state mars is nearly or perhaps totally geologically dead the end of volcanic activity has apparently stopped the recycling of chemicals and minerals between the surface and interior of the planet  investigations have been performed on mars by the landers  and rovers lander and rover evidence suggests that the planet was once significantly more habitable than it is today but whether living organisms ever existed there remains unknown the viking probes of the mid- carried experiments designed to detect microorganisms in martian soil at their respective landing sites and had positive results including a temporary increase of production on exposure to water and nutrients this sign of life was later disputed by scientists resulting in a continuing debate with nasa scientist gilbert levin asserting that viking may have found life a re-analysis of the viking data in light of modern knowledge of extremophile forms of life has suggested that the viking tests were not sophisticated enough to detect these forms of life the tests could even have killed a hypothetical life form  tests conducted by the phoenix mars lander have shown that the soil has an alkaline ph and it contains magnesium sodium potassium and chloride  the soil nutrients may be able to support life but life would still have to be shielded from the intense ultraviolet light  a recent analysis of martian meteorite found  ppm   ppm  and ppm  most likely of martian origin the suggests the presence of other highly oxidizing oxychlorines such as or  produced both by uv oxidation of cl and x-ray radiolysis of  thus only highly refractory andor well-protected sub-surface organics or life forms are likely to survive   a analysis of the phoenix wcl showed that the in the phoenix soil has not interacted with liquid water of any form perhaps for as long as years if it had the highly soluble in contact with liquid water would have formed only  this suggests a severely arid environment with minimal or no liquid water interaction  scientists have proposed that carbonate globules found in meteorite  which is thought to have originated from mars could be fossilized microbes extant on mars when the meteorite was blasted from the martian surface by a meteor strike some years ago this proposal has been met with skepticism and an exclusively inorganic origin for the shapes has been proposed  small quantities of methane and formaldehyde detected by mars orbiters are both claimed to be possible evidence for life as these chemical compounds would quickly break down in the martian atmosphere   alternatively these compounds may instead be replenished by volcanic or other geological means such as serpentinite   planum australe impact glass  formed by the impact of meteors which on earth can preserve signs of life has been found on the surface of the impact craters on mars   likewise the glass in impact craters on mars could have preserved signs of life if life existed at the site    in may  evidence of the earliest known life on land on earth may have been found in -billion-year-old geyserite and other related mineral deposits often found around hot springs and geysers  uncovered in the pilbara craton of western australia  these findings may be helpful in deciding where best to  for early signs of life on the planet mars    in early  media reports speculated that certain rock features at a site called jura looked like a type of fossil but project scientists say the formations likely resulted from a geological process at the bottom of an ancient drying lakebed and are related to mineral veins in the area similar to gypsum crystals  on june  nasa announced that the rover had discovered organic compounds in sedimentary rocks dating to three billion years old  indicating that some of the building blocks for life were present   in july  scientists reported the discovery of a subglacial lake on mars the first known stable body of water on the planet it sits   below the surface at the base of the southern polar ice cap and is about kilometres  wide   the lake was discovered using the marsis radar on board the mars express orbiter and the profiles were collected between may and december   the lake is centered at east south a flat area that does not exhibit any peculiar topographic characteristics it is mostly surrounded by higher ground except on its eastern side where there is a depression  moons of mars phobos moon deimos moon phobos crater chains stickney crater deimos regolith mars has two relatively small compared to earth natural moons phobos about kilometres  in diameter and deimos about kilometres  in diameter which orbit close to the planet asteroid capture is a long-favored theory but their origin remains uncertain  both satellites were discovered in by asaph hall  they are named after the characters phobos panicfear and deimos terrordread who in greek mythology  accompanied their father ares  god of war into battle mars was the roman counterpart of ares   in modern greek  the planet retains its ancient name aris   from the surface of mars the motions of phobos and deimos appear different from that of the moon  phobos rises in the west sets in the east and rises again in just hours deimos being only just outside synchronous orbit where the orbital period would match the planet period of rotation rises as expected in the east but slowly despite the -hour orbit of deimos  days elapse between its rise and set for an equatorial observer as it slowly falls behind the rotation of mars  because the orbit of phobos is below synchronous altitude the tidal forces from the planet mars are gradually lowering its orbit in about years it could either crash into mars surface or break up into a ring structure around the planet  the origin of the two moons is not well understood their low albedo and carbonaceous chondrite composition have been regarded as similar to asteroids supporting the capture theory the unstable orbit of phobos would seem to point towards a relatively recent capture but both have circular orbits  near the equator which is unusual for captured objects and the required capture dynamics are complex accretion early in the history of mars is plausible but would not account for a composition resembling asteroids rather than mars itself if that is confirmed a third possibility is the involvement of a third body or a type of impact disruption  more-recent lines of evidence for phobos having a highly porous interior  and suggesting a composition containing mainly phyllosilicates and other minerals known from mars  point toward an origin of phobos from material ejected by an impact on mars that reaccreted in martian orbit  similar to the prevailing theory for the origin of earth moon although the vnir spectra of the moons of mars resemble those of outer-belt asteroids the thermal infrared spectra of phobos are reported to be inconsistent with chondrites of any class  mars may have moons smaller than to metres  to  in diameter and a dust ring is predicted to exist between phobos and deimos  exploration of mars mars science laboratory rover mars reconnaissance orbiter dozens of crewless spacecraft  including orbiters  landers  and rovers  have

looping motion with respect to the background stars the duration of this retrograde motion lasts for about days and mars reaches its peak luminosity in the middle of this motion  the point at which mars geocentric longitude is different from the sun is known as opposition  which is near the time of closest approach to earth the time of opposition can occur as much as  days away from the closest approach the distance at close approach varies between about and  and  due to the planets elliptical orbits which causes comparable variation in angular size    the second-to-last mars opposition occurred on july   at a distance of about   the last mars opposition occurred on october  at a distance of about   the average time between the successive oppositions of mars its synodic period  is days but the number of days between the dates of successive oppositions can range from to   as mars approaches opposition it begins a period of retrograde motion  which makes it appear to move backwards in a looping motion relative to the background stars the duration of this retrograde motion is about days mars made its closest approach to earth and maximum apparent brightness in nearly  years    magnitude  on august  at  utc this occurred when mars was one day from opposition and about three days from its perihelion  making it particularly easy to see from earth the last time it came so close is estimated to have been on september  bc  the next time being in   this record approach was only slightly closer than other recent close approaches for instance the minimum distance on august  was au  and the minimum distance on august  will be au   every to years mars comes into opposition near its perihelion these perihelic oppositions make a closer approach to earth than other oppositions which occur every  years mars comes into perihelic opposition in  and  with and being close to perihelic opposition history of mars observation the history of observations of mars is marked by the oppositions of mars when the planet is closest to earth and hence is most easily visible which occur every couple of years even more notable are the perihelic oppositions of mars which occur every or years and are distinguished because mars is close to perihelion making it even closer to earth galileo galilei  the ancient sumerians believed that mars was nergal  the god of war and plague  during sumerian times nergal was a minor deity of little significance  but during later times his main cult center was the city of nineveh   in mesopotamian texts mars is referred to as the star of judgement of the fate of the dead  the existence of mars as a wandering object in the night sky was recorded by the ancient egyptian astronomers and by bce they were familiar with the retrograde motion of the planet  by the period of the neo-babylonian empire  the babylonian astronomers were making regular records of the positions of the planets and systematic observations of their behavior for mars they knew that the planet made synodic periods  or circuits of the zodiac every years they invented arithmetic methods for making minor corrections to the predicted positions of the planets   in ancient greece  the planet was known as   in the fourth century bce aristotle noted that mars disappeared behind the moon during an occultation  indicating that the planet was farther away  ptolemy  a greek living in alexandria   attempted to address the problem of the orbital motion of mars ptolemy model and his collective work on astronomy was presented in the multi-volume collection almagest  which became the authoritative treatise on western astronomy for the next fourteen centuries  literature from ancient china confirms that mars was known by chinese astronomers by no later than the fourth century bce  in the east asian cultures mars is traditionally referred to as the fire star chinese  based on the five elements     during the seventeenth century tycho brahe measured the diurnal parallax of mars that johannes kepler used to make a preliminary calculation of the relative distance to the planet  when the telescope became available the diurnal parallax of mars was again measured in an effort to determine the sun-earth distance this was first performed by giovanni domenico cassini in  the early parallax measurements were hampered by the quality of the instruments  the only occultation of mars by venus observed was that of october  seen by michael maestlin at heidelberg   in  mars was viewed by italian astronomer galileo galilei  who was first to see it via telescope  the first person to draw a map of mars that displayed any terrain features was the dutch astronomer christiaan huygens   hubble space telescope martian canal by the century the resolution of telescopes reached a level sufficient for surface features to be identified a perihelic opposition of mars occurred on september  in that year the italian astronomer giovanni schiaparelli used a centimetres  telescope in milan to help produce the first detailed map of mars these maps notably contained features he called  which were later shown to be an optical illusion  these were supposedly long straight lines on the surface of mars to which he gave names of famous rivers on earth his term which means channels or grooves was popularly mistranslated in english as canals   influenced by the observations the orientalist percival lowell founded an observatory which had and centimetres  and  telescopes the observatory was used for the exploration of mars during the last good opportunity in and the following less favorable oppositions he published several books on mars and life on the planet which had a great influence on the public   the were independently found by other astronomers like henri joseph perrotin and louis thollon in nice using one of the largest telescopes of that time   the seasonal changes consisting of the diminishing of the polar caps and the dark areas formed during martian summer in combination with the canals led to speculation about life on mars and it was a long-held belief that mars contained vast seas and vegetation the telescope never reached the resolution required to give proof to any speculations as bigger telescopes were used fewer long straight were observed during an observation in by camille flammarion with an centimetres  telescope irregular patterns were observed but no were seen  near the end of the nineteenth century it was widely accepted in the astronomical community that mars had life-supporting qualities including oxygen and water however in w w campbell at lick observatory observed the planet and found that if water vapor or oxygen occur in the atmosphere of mars it is in quantities too small to be detected by spectroscopes then available this contradicted many of the measurements of the time and was not widely accepted campbell and v m slipher repeated the study in using better instruments but with the same results it wasn until the findings were confirmed by w s adams in that the myth of the earth-like habitability of mars was finally broken  however even in the  articles were published on martian biology putting aside explanations other than life for the seasonal changes on mars detailed scenarios for the metabolism and chemical cycles for a functional ecosystem have been published  exploration of mars once spacecraft visited the planet during nasa mariner missions in the and  these concepts were radically broken the results of the viking life-detection experiments aided an intermission in which the hypothesis of a hostile dead planet was generally accepted  mariner and viking allowed better maps of mars to be made using the data from these missions and another major leap forward was the mars global surveyor mission launched in and operated until late  that allowed complete extremely detailed maps of the martian topography magnetic field and surface minerals to be obtained  these maps are available online for example at google mars  mars reconnaissance orbiter and mars express continued exploring with new instruments and supporting lander missions nasa provides two online tools mars trek  which provides visualizations of the planet using data from years of exploration and experience curiosity  which simulates traveling on mars in -d with curiosity  mars in culture mars in fiction mars is named after the roman god of war  in different cultures mars represents masculinity and youth its symbol  a circle with an arrow pointing out to the upper right is used as a symbol for the male gender the many failures in mars exploration probes resulted in a satirical counter-culture blaming the failures on an earth-mars  bermuda triangle  a  mars curse  or a great galactic ghoul that feeds on martian spacecraft  the fashionable idea that mars was populated by intelligent martians exploded in the late century schiaparelli canali observations combined with percival lowell books on the subject put forward the standard notion of a planet that was a drying cooling dying world with ancient civilizations constructing irrigation works  many other observations and proclamations by notable personalities added to what has been termed mars fever  in  while investigating atmospheric radio noise using his receivers in his colorado springs lab inventor nikola tesla observed repetitive signals that he later surmised might have been radio communications coming from another planet possibly mars in a interview tesla said it was some time afterward when the thought flashed upon my mind that the disturbances i had observed might be due to an intelligent control although i could not decipher their meaning it was impossible for me to think of them as having been entirely accidental the feeling is constantly growing on me that i had been the first to hear the greeting of one planet to another  tesla theories gained support from lord kelvin who while visiting the united states in  was reported to have said that he thought tesla had picked up martian signals being sent to the united states  kelvin emphatically denied this report shortly before leaving what i really said was that the inhabitants of mars if there are any were doubtless able to see new york particularly the glare of the electricity  in a new york times article in  edward charles pickering  director of the harvard college observatory  said that they had received a telegram from lowell observatory in arizona that seemed to confirm that mars was trying to communicate with earth  early in december  we received from lowell observatory in arizona a telegram that a shaft of light had been seen to project from mars the lowell observatory makes a specialty of mars lasting seventy minutes i wired these facts to europe and sent out neostyle copies through this country the observer there is a careful reliable man and there is no reason to doubt that the light existed it was given as from a well-known geographical point on mars that was all now the story has gone the world over in europe it is stated that i have been in communication with mars and all sorts of exaggerations have spring up whatever the light was we have no means of knowing whether it had intelligence or not no one can say it is absolutely inexplicable  pickering later proposed creating a set of mirrors in texas  intended to signal martians  the war of the worlds h g wells in recent decades the high-resolution mapping of the surface of mars culminating in mars global surveyor  revealed no artifacts of habitation by intelligent life but pseudoscientific speculation about intelligent life on mars continues from commentators such as richard c hoagland  reminiscent of the controversy these speculations are based on small scale features perceived in the spacecraft images such as pyramids and the  face on mars  planetary astronomer carl sagan wrote mars has become a kind of mythic arena onto which we have projected our earthly hopes and fears  the depiction of mars in fiction has been stimulated by its dramatic red color and by nineteenth-century scientific speculations that its surface conditions might support not just life but intelligent life  thus originated a large number of science fiction scenarios among which is h g wells  the war of the worlds  published in  in which martians seek to escape their dying planet by invading earth influential works included ray bradbury the martian chronicles  in which human explorers accidentally destroy a martian civilization edgar rice burroughs  series  c s lewis  novel out of the silent planet   and a number of robert a heinlein stories before the mid-sixties  jonathan swift made reference to the moons of mars about years before their actual discovery by asaph hall  detailing reasonably accurate descriptions of their orbits in the chapter of his novel gulliver travels   a comic figure of an intelligent martian marvin the martian  appeared in haredevil hare  as a character in the looney tunes animated cartoons of warner brothers  and has continued as part of popular culture to the present  after the mariner and viking spacecraft had returned pictures of mars as it really is an apparently lifeless and canal-less world these ideas about mars had to be abandoned and a vogue for accurate realist depictions of human colonies on mars developed the best known of which may be kim stanley robinson trilogy  pseudo-scientific speculations about the face on mars and other enigmatic landmarks spotted by space probes have meant that ancient civilizations continue to be a popular theme in science fiction especially in film  interactive image map

with an average radius of about nine and a half times that of earth    it only has one-eighth the average density of earth however with its larger volume saturn is over times more massive    saturn is named after the roman god of wealth and agriculture  its astronomical symbol  represents the god sickle  the romans named the seventh day of the week saturday  saturn day no later than the century for the planet saturn  saturn interior is most likely composed of a core of ironnickel and rock  silicon and oxygen compounds its core is surrounded by a deep layer of metallic hydrogen  an intermediate layer of liquid hydrogen and liquid helium  and finally a gaseous outer layer saturn has a pale yellow hue due to ammonia crystals in its upper atmosphere an electrical current within the metallic hydrogen layer is thought to give rise to saturn planetary magnetic field  which is weaker than the earth but which has a magnetic moment times that of earth due to saturn larger size saturn magnetic field strength is around one-twentieth of jupiter  the outer atmosphere is generally bland and lacking in contrast although long-lived features can appear wind speeds on saturn can reach h  s higher than on jupiter but not as high as on neptune   the planet most famous feature is its prominent ring system  which is composed mostly of ice particles with a smaller amount of rocky debris and dust  at least moons  are known to orbit saturn of which are officially named this does not include the hundreds of moonlets in its rings titan  saturn largest moon and the second largest in the solar system is larger than the planet mercury  although less massive and is the only moon in the solar system to have a substantial atmosphere  contents saturn is a gas giant composed predominantly of hydrogen and helium it lacks a definite surface though it may have a solid core  saturn rotation causes it to have the shape of an oblate spheroid  that is it is flattened at the poles and bulges at its equator  its equatorial and polar radii differ by almost   versus   jupiter uranus  and neptune the other giant planets in the solar system are also oblate but to a lesser extent the combination of the bulge and rotation rate means that the effective surface gravity along the equator  is  of what it is at the poles and is lower than the surface gravity of earth however the equatorial escape velocity of nearly is much higher than that of earth  saturn is the only planet of the solar system that is less dense than waterabout  less  although saturn core is considerably denser than water the average specific density of the planet is due to the atmosphere jupiter has times earth mass   and saturn is times earth mass  together jupiter and saturn hold  of the total planetary mass in the solar system  despite consisting mostly of hydrogen and helium most of saturn mass is not in the gas phase  because hydrogen becomes a non-ideal liquid when the density is above  which is reached at a radius containing  of saturn mass the temperature pressure and density inside saturn all rise steadily toward the core which causes hydrogen to be a metal in the deeper layers  standard planetary models suggest that the interior of saturn is similar to that of jupiter having a small rocky core surrounded by hydrogen and helium with trace amounts of various volatiles   this core is similar in composition to earth but is more dense the examination of saturn gravitational moment  in combination with physical models of the interior has allowed constraints to be placed on the mass of saturn core in  scientists estimated that the core must be times the mass of earth   which corresponds to a diameter of about   this is surrounded by a thicker liquid metallic hydrogen layer followed by a liquid layer of helium-saturated molecular hydrogen that gradually transitions to a gas with increasing altitude the outermost layer spans  and consists of gas    saturn has a hot interior reaching  at its core and radiates  times more energy into space than it receives from the sun jupiter thermal energy is generated by the kelvinhelmholtz mechanism of slow gravitational compression  but such a process alone may not be sufficient to explain heat production for saturn because it is less massive an alternative or additional mechanism may be generation of heat through the raining out of droplets of helium deep in saturn interior as the droplets descend through the lower-density hydrogen the process releases heat by friction and leaves saturn outer layers depleted of helium   these descending droplets may have accumulated into a helium shell surrounding the core  rainfalls of diamonds have been suggested to occur within saturn as well as in jupiter  and ice giants uranus and neptune  methane the outer atmosphere of saturn contains  molecular hydrogen and  helium by volume  the proportion of helium is significantly deficient compared to the abundance of this element in the sun  the quantity of elements heavier than helium  metallicity  is not known precisely but the proportions are assumed to match the primordial abundances from the formation of the solar system  the total mass of these heavier elements is estimated to be times the mass of the earth with a significant fraction located in saturn core region  trace amounts of ammonia acetylene  ethane  propane  phosphine  and methane have been detected in saturn atmosphere    the upper clouds are composed of ammonia crystals while the lower level clouds appear to consist of either ammonium hydrosulfide   or water  ultraviolet radiation from the sun causes methane photolysis in the upper atmosphere leading to a series of hydrocarbon chemical reactions with the resulting products being carried downward by eddies and diffusion  this photochemical cycle is modulated by saturn annual seasonal cycle  saturn atmosphere exhibits a banded pattern similar to jupiter but saturn bands are much fainter and are much wider near the equator the nomenclature used to describe these bands is the same as on jupiter saturn finer cloud patterns were not observed until the flybys of the voyager spacecraft during the  since then earth-based telescopy has improved to the point where regular observations can be made  the composition of the clouds varies with depth and increasing pressure in the upper cloud layers with the temperature in the range and pressures extending between  bar  the clouds consist of ammonia ice water ice clouds begin at a level where the pressure is about  bar and extend down to  bar where temperatures range from to  intermixed in this layer is a band of ammonium hydrosulfide ice lying in the pressure range bar with temperatures of  finally the lower layers where pressures are between and bar and temperatures are  contains a region of water droplets with ammonia in aqueous solution  saturn usually bland atmosphere occasionally exhibits long-lived ovals and other features common on jupiter in  the hubble space telescope imaged an enormous white cloud near saturn equator that was not present during the encounters and in another smaller storm was observed the storm was an example of a great white spot  a unique but short-lived phenomenon that occurs once every saturnian year roughly every earth years around the time of the northern hemisphere summer solstice   previous great white spots were observed in   and  with the storm being the most famous if the periodicity is maintained another storm will occur in about   the winds on saturn are the second fastest among the solar system planets after neptune data indicate peak easterly winds of s h  in images from the cassini spacecraft during  saturn northern hemisphere displayed a bright blue hue similar to uranus the color was most likely caused by rayleigh scattering   thermography has shown that saturn south pole has a warm polar vortex  the only known example of such a phenomenon in the solar system  whereas temperatures on saturn are normally  temperatures on the vortex often reach as high as  suspected to be the warmest spot on saturn  saturn hexagon ir a persisting hexagonal wave pattern around the north polar vortex in the atmosphere at about was first noted in the images    the sides of the hexagon are each about   long which is longer than the diameter of the earth  the entire structure rotates with a period of the same period as that of the planet radio emissions which is assumed to be equal to the period of rotation of saturn interior  the hexagonal feature does not shift in longitude like the other clouds in the visible atmosphere  the pattern origin is a matter of much speculation most scientists think it is a standing wave pattern in the atmosphere polygonal shapes have been replicated in the laboratory through differential rotation of fluids   hst imaging of the south polar region indicates the presence of a jet stream  but no strong polar vortex nor any hexagonal standing wave  nasa reported in november that had observed a  hurricane -like storm locked to the south pole that had a clearly defined eyewall    eyewall clouds had not previously been seen on any planet other than earth for example images from the galileo spacecraft did not show an eyewall in the great red spot of jupiter  the south pole storm may have been present for billions of years  this vortex is comparable to the size of earth and it has winds of h  observed a series of cloud features found in northern latitudes nicknamed the string of pearls these features are cloud clearings that reside in deeper cloud layers  magnetosphere of saturn  saturn has an intrinsic magnetic field that has a simple symmetric shape a magnetic dipole  its strength at the equator  gauss  t  is approximately one twentieth of that of the field around jupiter and slightly weaker than earth magnetic field  as a result saturn magnetosphere is much smaller than jupiter  when voyager entered the magnetosphere the solar wind pressure was high and the magnetosphere extended only saturn radii or  km   although it enlarged within several hours and remained so for about three days  most probably the magnetic field is generated similarly to that of jupiter by currents in the liquid metallic-hydrogen layer called a metallic-hydrogen dynamo  this magnetosphere is efficient at deflecting the solar wind particles from the sun the moon titan orbits within the outer part of saturn magnetosphere and contributes plasma from the ionized particles in titan outer atmosphere  saturn magnetosphere like earth  produces aurorae   the average distance between saturn and the sun is over  kilometers  au  with an average orbital speed of s  it takes saturn  earth days or about years  to finish one revolution around the sun  as a consequence it forms a near  mean-motion resonance with jupiter  the elliptical orbit of saturn is inclined  relative to the orbital plane of the earth  the perihelion and aphelion distances are respectively  and  on average   the visible features on saturn rotate at different rates depending on latitude and multiple rotation periods have been assigned to various regions as in jupiter case astronomers use three different systems for specifying the rotation rate of saturn has a period of d and encompasses the equatorial zone the south equatorial belt and the north equatorial belt the polar regions are considered to have rotation rates similar to  all other saturnian latitudes excluding the north and south polar regions are indicated as and have been assigned a rotation period of d refers to saturn internal rotation rate based on radio emissions from the planet detected by voyager and   systemiii has a rotation period of d systemiii has largely superseded systemii  a precise value for the rotation period of the interior remains elusive while approaching saturn in  found that the radio rotation period of saturn had increased appreciably to approximately    an estimate of saturn rotation as an indicated rotation rate for saturn as a whole based on a compilation of various measurements from the  and probes is   studies of the planet c ring yield a rotation period of    in march  it was found that the variation of radio emissions from the planet did not match saturn rotation rate this variance may be caused by geyser activity on saturn moon enceladus  the water vapor emitted into saturn orbit by this activity becomes charged and creates a drag upon saturn magnetic field slowing its rotation slightly relative to the rotation of the planet    an apparent oddity for saturn is that it does not have any known trojan asteroids  these are minor planets that orbit the sun at the stable lagrangian points  designated l and l  located at angles to the planet along its orbit trojan asteroids have been discovered for mars  jupiter uranus and neptune orbital resonance mechanisms including secular resonance  are believed to be the cause of the missing saturnian trojans  moons of saturn moons dione tethys mimas enceladus rhea titan iapetus voyager saturn has known moons   of which have formal names   in addition there is evidence of dozens to hundreds of moonlets with diameters of meters in saturn rings  which are not considered to be true moons titan  the largest moon comprises more than  of the mass in orbit around saturn including the rings  saturn second-largest moon rhea  may have a tenuous ring system of its own   along with a tenuous atmosphere     many of the other moons are small are less than in diameter and another between and in diameter  traditionally most of saturn moons have been named after titans of greek mythology titan is the only satellite in the solar system with a major atmosphere    in which a complex organic chemistry occurs it is the only satellite with hydrocarbon lakes    on june  scientists at the iaa-csic reported the detection of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the upper atmosphere of titan a possible precursor for life   on june  nasa claimed to have strong evidence that nitrogen in the atmosphere of titan came from materials in the oort cloud  associated with comets  and not from the materials that formed saturn in earlier times  saturn moon enceladus  which seems similar in chemical makeup to comets  has often been regarded as a potential habitat for microbial life      evidence of this possibility includes the satellite salt-rich particles having an ocean-like composition that indicates most of enceladus expelled ice comes from the evaporation of liquid salt water    a flyby by through a plume on enceladus found most of the ingredients to sustain life forms that live by methanogenesis   in april  nasa scientists reported the possible beginning of a new moon within the a ring  which was imaged by on april   rings of saturn rings of saturn cassini  uv b a cassini division encke gap saturn is probably best known for the system of planetary rings that makes it visually unique  the rings extend from  to  kilometers  to  outward from saturn equator and average approximately meters  in thickness they are composed predominantly of water ice with trace amounts of tholin impurities and a peppered coating of approximately  amorphous carbon   the particles that make up the rings range in size from specks of dust up to   while the other gas giants also have ring systems saturn is the largest and most visible there are two main hypotheses regarding the origin of the rings one hypothesis is that the rings are remnants of a destroyed moon of saturn the second hypothesis is that the rings are left over from the original nebular material from which saturn was formed some ice in the e ring comes from the moon enceladus geysers     the water abundance of the rings varies radially with the outermost ring a being the most pure in ice water this abundance variance may be explained by meteor bombardment  beyond the main rings at a distance of km from the planet is the sparse phoebe ring it is tilted at an angle of to the other rings and like phoebe  orbits in retrograde fashion  some of the moons of saturn including pandora and prometheus  act as shepherd moons to confine the rings and prevent them from spreading out  pan and atlas cause weak linear density waves in saturn rings that have yielded more reliable calculations of their masses  galileo galilei the observation and exploration of saturn can be divided into three phases the first phase is ancient observations such as with the naked eye  before the invention of modern telescopes  the second phase began in the century with telescopic observations from earth which improved over time the third phase is visitation by space probes  in orbit or on flyby  in the century telescopic observations continue from earth including earth-orbiting observatories like the hubble space telescope  and until its retirement  from the cassini orbiter around saturn saturn mythology saturn has been known since prehistoric times  and in early recorded history it was a major character in various mythologies babylonian astronomers systematically observed and recorded the movements of saturn  in ancient greek the planet was known as phainon   and in roman times it was known as the star of saturn   in ancient roman mythology  the planet phainon was sacred to this agricultural god from which the planet takes its modern name  the romans considered the god saturnus the equivalent of the greek god cronus  in modern greek  the planet retains the name    the greek scientist ptolemy based his calculations of saturn orbit on observations he made while it was in opposition   in hindu astrology  there are nine astrological objects known as navagrahas  saturn is known as  shani  and judges everyone based on the good and bad deeds performed in life   ancient chinese and japanese culture designated the planet saturn as the earth star   this was based on five elements which were traditionally used to classify natural elements    in ancient hebrew  saturn is called   its angel is cassiel  its intelligence or beneficial spirit is  hebrew   romanized   and its darker spirit  demon  is zzl  hebrew   romanized     zazel has been described as a great angel  invoked in solomonic magic  who is effective in love conjurations    in ottoman turkish  urdu and malay  the name of zazel is  derived from the arabic language  arabic   romanized   robert hooke saturn rings require at least a -mm-diameter telescope  to resolve and thus were not known to exist until christiaan huygens saw them in  galileo  with his primitive telescope in    incorrectly thought of saturn appearing not quite round as two moons on saturn sides   it was not until huygens used greater telescopic magnification that this notion was refuted and the rings were truly seen for the first time huygens also discovered saturn moon titan giovanni domenico cassini later discovered four other moons iapetus  rhea  tethys and dione  in  cassini discovered the gap now known as the cassini division   no further discoveries of significance were made until when william herschel discovered two further moons mimas and enceladus  the irregularly shaped satellite hyperion  which has a resonance with titan was discovered in by a british team  in william henry pickering discovered phoebe a highly irregular satellite that does not rotate synchronously with saturn as the larger moons do  phoebe was the first such satellite found and it takes more than a year to orbit saturn in a retrograde orbit  during the early century re on titan led to the confirmation in that it had a thick atmosphere a feature unique among the solar system moons  exploration of saturn pioneer made the first flyby of saturn in september  when it passed within  of the planet cloud tops images were taken of the planet and a few of its moons although their resolution was too low to discern surface detail the spacecraft also studied saturn rings revealing the thin f-ring and the fact that dark gaps in the rings are bright when viewed at high phase angle towards the sun meaning that they contain fine light-scattering material in addition measured the temperature of titan  in november  the voyager probe visited the saturn system it sent back the first high-resolution images of the planet its rings and satellites surface features of various moons were seen for the first time performed a close flyby of titan increasing knowledge of the atmosphere of the moon it proved that titan atmosphere is impenetrable in visible wavelengths  therefore no surface details were seen the flyby changed the spacecraft trajectory out from the plane of the solar system  almost a year later in august  voyager continued the study of the saturn system more close-up images of saturn moons were acquired as well as evidence of changes in the atmosphere and the rings unfortunately during the flyby the probe turnable camera platform stuck for a couple of days and some planned imaging was lost saturn gravity was used to direct the spacecraft trajectory towards uranus  the probes discovered and confirmed several new satellites orbiting near or within the planet rings as well as the small maxwell gap a gap within the c ring  and keeler gap a -wide gap in the a ring  cassinihuygens the cassinihuygens space probe entered orbit around saturn on july  in june  it conducted a close flyby of phoebe  sending back high-resolution images and data flyby of saturn largest moon titan captured radar images of large lakes and their coastlines with numerous islands and mountains the orbiter completed two titan flybys before releasing the probe on december  descended onto the surface of titan on january   starting in early  scientists used to track lightning on saturn the power of the lightning is approximately  that of lightning on earth  tiger stripes  in  nasa reported that had found evidence of liquid water reservoirs no more than tens of meters below the surface that erupt in geysers on saturn moon enceladus  these jets of icy particles are emitted into orbit around saturn from vents in the moon south polar region  over geysers have been identified on enceladus  in may  nasa scientists reported that enceladus is emerging as the most habitable spot beyond earth in the solar system for life as we know it   photographs have revealed a previously undiscovered planetary ring outside the brighter main rings of saturn and inside the g and erings the source of this ring is hypothesized to be the crashing of a meteoroid off janus and epimetheus   in july  images were returned of hydrocarbon lakes near titan north pole the presence of which were confirmed in january  in march  hydrocarbon seas were found near the north pole the largest of which is almost the size of the caspian sea   in october  the probe detected an  diameter cyclone-like storm with an eyewall at saturn south pole  from to november  the probe discovered and confirmed eight new satellites  in april sent back images of a hurricane at the planet north pole times larger than those found on earth with winds faster than h   on september  the spacecraft performed the grand finale of its mission a number of passes through gaps between saturn and saturn inner rings   the atmospheric entry of ended the mission the continued exploration of saturn is still considered to be a viable option for nasa as part of their ongoing new frontiers program of missions nasa previously requested for plans to be put forward for a mission to saturn that included the saturn atmospheric entry probe  and possible investigations into the habitability and possible discovery of life on saturn moons titan and enceladus by dragonfly    saturn is the most distant of the five planets easily visible to the naked eye from earth the other four being mercury  venus  mars and jupiter uranus and occasionally vesta  are visible to the naked eye in dark skies saturn appears to the naked eye in the night sky as a bright yellowish point of light the mean apparent magnitude of saturn is  with a standard deviation of   most of the magnitude variation is due to the inclination of the ring system relative to the sun and earth the brightest magnitude  occurs near in time to when the plane of the rings is inclined most highly and the faintest magnitude  occurs around the time when they are least inclined  it takes approximately  years for the planet to complete an entire circuit of the ecliptic against the background constellations of the zodiac  most people will require an optical aid very large binoculars or a small telescope that magnifies at least times to achieve an image of saturn rings in which clear resolution is present   when earth passes through the ring plane which occurs twice every saturnian year roughly every earth years the rings briefly disappear from view because they are so thin such a disappearance will next occur in  but saturn will be too close to the sun for observations  cassini saturn and its rings are best seen when the planet is at or near opposition  the configuration of a planet when it is at an elongation of  and thus appears opposite the sun in the sky a saturnian opposition occurs every yearapproximately every daysand results in the planet appearing at its brightest both the earth and saturn orbit the sun on eccentric orbits which means their distances from the sun vary over time and therefore so do their distances from each other hence varying the brightness of saturn from one opposition to the next saturn also appears brighter when the rings are angled such that they are more visible for example during the opposition of december  saturn appeared at its brightest due to a favorable orientation of its rings relative to the earth  even though saturn was closer to the earth and sun in late   hst from time to time saturn is occulted by the moon that is the moon covers up saturn in the sky as with all the planets in the solar system occultations of saturn occur in seasons saturnian occultations will take place monthly for about a -month period followed by about a five-year period in which no such activity is registered the moon orbit is inclined by several degrees relative to saturn so occultations will only occur when

its name is a reference to the greek god of the sky uranus  who according to greek mythology  was the great-grandfather of ares  mars  grandfather of zeus  jupiter  and father of cronus  saturn  it has the third-largest planetary radius and fourth-largest planetary mass in the solar system  uranus is similar in composition to neptune  and both have bulk chemical compositions which differ from that of the larger gas giants jupiter and saturn  for this reason scientists often classify uranus and neptune as  ice giants  to distinguish them from the other giant planets uranus atmosphere is similar to jupiter and saturn in its primary composition of hydrogen and helium  but it contains more  ices  such as water ammonia  and methane  along with traces of other hydrocarbons   it has the coldest planetary atmosphere in the solar system with a minimum temperature of   and has a complex layered cloud structure with water thought to make up the lowest clouds and methane the uppermost layer of clouds  the interior of uranus is mainly composed of ices and rock  like the other giant planets  uranus has a ring system  a magnetosphere  and numerous moons  the uranian system has a unique configuration because its axis of rotation is tilted sideways nearly into the plane of its solar orbit its north and south poles therefore lie where most other planets have their equators   in  images from showed uranus as an almost featureless planet in visible light without the cloud bands or storms associated with the other giant planets  remains the only spacecraft to visit the planet  observations from earth have shown seasonal change and increased weather activity as uranus approached its equinox in  wind speeds can reach metres per second h   contents like the classical planets  uranus is visible to the naked eye but it was never recognised as a planet by ancient observers because of its dimness and slow orbit  sir william herschel first observed uranus on march  leading to its discovery as a planet expanding the known boundaries of the solar system for the first time in history and making uranus the first planet classified as such with the aid of a telescope  william herschel uranus had been observed on many occasions before its recognition as a planet but it was generally mistaken for a star possibly the earliest known observation was by hipparchos  who in bc might have recorded it as a star for his star catalogue that was later incorporated into ptolemy almagest   the earliest definite sighting was in  when john flamsteed observed it at least six times cataloguing it as tauri  the french astronomer pierre charles le monnier observed uranus at least twelve times between and   including on four consecutive nights sir william herschel observed uranus on march from the garden of his house at new king street in bath somerset  england now the herschel museum of astronomy   and initially reported it on april  as a comet   with a homemade -inch reflecting telescope herschel engaged in a series of observations on the parallax of the fixed stars   herschel recorded in his journal in the quartile near tauri  either a nebulous star or perhaps a comet  on march he noted i looked for the comet or nebulous star and found that it is a comet for it has changed its place  when he presented his discovery to the royal society  he continued to assert that he had found a comet but also implicitly compared it to a planet  the power i had on when i first saw the comet was  from experience i know that the diameters of the fixed stars are not proportionally magnified with higher powers as planets are therefore i now put the powers at and  and found that the diameter of the comet increased in proportion to the power as it ought to be on the supposition of its not being a fixed star while the diameters of the stars to which i compared it were not increased in the same ratio moreover the comet being magnified much beyond what its light would admit of appeared hazy and ill-defined with these great powers while the stars preserved that lustre and distinctness which from many thousand observations i knew they would retain the sequel has shown that my surmises were well-founded this proving to be the comet we have lately observed  herschel notified the astronomer royal nevil maskelyne of his discovery and received this flummoxed reply from him on april  i don know what to call it it is as likely to be a regular planet moving in an orbit nearly circular to the sun as a comet moving in a very eccentric ellipsis i have not yet seen any coma or tail to it  although herschel continued to describe his new object as a comet other astronomers had already begun to suspect otherwise finnish-swedish astronomer anders johan lexell  working in russia was the first to compute the orbit of the new object  its nearly circular orbit led him to a conclusion that it was a planet rather than a comet berlin astronomer johann elert bode described herschel discovery as a moving star that can be deemed a hitherto unknown planet-like object circulating beyond the orbit of saturn  bode concluded that its near-circular orbit was more like a planet than a comet  the object was soon universally accepted as a new planet by  herschel acknowledged this to royal society president joseph banks  by the observation of the most eminent astronomers in europe it appears that the new star which i had the honour of pointing out to them in march  is a primary planet of our solar system  in recognition of his achievement king george iii gave herschel an annual stipend of on condition that he move to windsor so that the royal family could look through his telescopes equivalent to  in    the name of uranus references the ancient greek deity of the sky uranus  ancient greek   the father of cronus  saturn  and grandfather of zeus  jupiter  which in latin became  urans   it is the only planet whose english name is derived directly from a figure of greek mythology  the adjectival form of uranus is uranian  the pronunciation of the name preferred among astronomers is     with stress on the first syllable as in latin  in contrast to    with stress on the second syllable and a long  though both are considered acceptable f consensus on the name was not reached until almost years after the planet discovery during the original discussions following discovery maskelyne asked herschel to do the astronomical world the faver  sic  to give a name to your planet which is entirely your own and which we are so much obliged to you for the discovery of  in response to maskelyne request herschel decided to name the object george star or the georgian planet in honour of his new patron king george iii  he explained this decision in a letter to joseph banks  in the fabulous ages of ancient times the appellations of mercury venus mars jupiter and saturn were given to the planets as being the names of their principal heroes and divinities in the present more philosophical era it would hardly be allowable to have recourse to the same method and call it juno pallas apollo or minerva for a name to our new heavenly body the first consideration of any particular event or remarkable incident seems to be its chronology if in any future age it should be asked when this last-found planet was discovered it would be a very satisfactory answer to say the reign of king george the third herschel proposed name was not popular outside britain and alternatives were soon proposed astronomer jrme lalande proposed that it be named in honour of its discoverer  swedish astronomer erik prosperin proposed the name  which was supported by other astronomers who liked the idea to commemorate the victories of the british royal naval fleet in the course of the american revolutionary war by calling the new planet even or   in a march treatise bode proposed  the latinised version of the greek god of the sky ouranos   bode argued that the name should follow the mythology so as not to stand out as different from the other planets and that uranus was an appropriate name as the father of the first generation of the titans   he also noted that elegance of the name in that just as saturn was the father of jupiter  the new planet should be named after the father of saturn     in  bode royal academy colleague martin klaproth named his newly discovered element uranium in support of bode choice  ultimately bode suggestion became the most widely used and became universal in when hm nautical almanac office  the final holdout switched from using to   uranus has two astronomical symbols  the first to be proposed  g was suggested by lalande in  in a letter to herschel lalande described it as   a globe surmounted by the first letter of your surname  a later proposal  h is a hybrid of the symbols for mars and the sun because uranus was the sky in greek mythology which was thought to be dominated by the combined powers of the sun and mars  uranus is called by a variety of translations in other languages in chinese  japanese  korean  and vietnamese  its name is literally translated as the sky king star       in thai  its official name is   as in english its other name in thai is   star of mtyu after the sanskrit word for  mrtyu   in mongolian  its name is   translated as of the sky reflecting its namesake god role as the ruler of the heavens in hawaiian  its name is  a loanword for the discoverer herschel  in mori  its name is    infrared rings moons hubble space telescope nicmos camera uranus orbits the sun once every years taking an average of seven years to pass through each of the dozen constellations of the zodiac in  the planet will have made its third complete orbit around the sun since being discovered in  the planet has returned to the point of its discovery northeast of zeta tauri twice since then in and  one day later each time as the precession of the equinoxes has shifted it west every years uranus will return to this location again in  its average distance from the sun is roughly au  billion km  mi  the difference between its minimum and maximum distance from the sun is  au larger than that of any other planet though not as large as that of dwarf planet pluto   the intensity of sunlight varies inversely with the square of distance and so on uranus at about times the distance from the sun compared to earth it is about  the intensity of light on earth  the orbital elements of uranus were first calculated in by pierre-simon laplace   with time discrepancies began to appear between the predicted and observed orbits and in  john couch adams first proposed that the differences might be due to the gravitational tug of an unseen planet in  urbain le verrier began his own independent re into uranus orbit on september  johann gottfried galle located a new planet  later named neptune  at nearly the position predicted by le verrier  the rotational period of the interior of uranus is   as on all the giant planets  its upper atmosphere experiences strong winds in the direction of rotation at some latitudes such as about degrees south visible features of the atmosphere move much faster making a full rotation in as little as hours  the uranian axis of rotation is approximately parallel with the plane of the solar system with an axial tilt of  as defined by prograde rotation this gives it seasonal changes completely unlike those of the other planets near the solstice  one pole faces the sun continuously and the other faces away only a narrow strip around the equator experiences a rapid daynight cycle but with the sun low over the horizon at the other side of uranus orbit the orientation of the poles towards the sun is reversed each pole gets around of continuous sunlight followed by of darkness  near the time of the equinoxes  the sun faces the equator of uranus giving a period of daynight cycles similar to those seen on most of the other planets uranus reached its most recent equinox on december    one result of this axis orientation is that averaged over the uranian year the polar regions of uranus receive a greater energy input from the sun than its equatorial regions nevertheless uranus is hotter at its equator than at its poles the underlying mechanism that causes this is unknown the reason for uranus unusual axial tilt is also not known with certainty but the usual speculation is that during the formation of the solar system an earth-sized protoplanet collided with uranus causing the skewed orientation  re by jacob kegerreis of durham university suggests that the tilt resulted from a rock larger than the earth crashing into the planet to years ago  uranus south pole was pointed almost directly at the sun at the time of flyby in  the labelling of this pole as south uses the definition currently endorsed by the international astronomical union  namely that the north pole of a planet or satellite is the pole that points above the invariable plane of the solar system regardless of the direction the planet is spinning   a different convention is sometimes used in which a body north and south poles are defined according to the right-hand rule in relation to the direction of rotation  the mean apparent magnitude of uranus is  with a standard deviation of  while the extremes are  and   this range of brightness is near the limit of naked eye visibility much of the variability is dependent upon the planetary latitudes being illuminated from the sun and viewed from the earth  its angular diameter is between  and  compared with to for saturn and to for jupiter  at opposition  uranus is visible to the naked eye in dark skies and becomes an easy target even in urban conditions with binoculars  in larger amateur telescopes with an objective diameter of between and  uranus appears as a pale cyan disk with distinct limb darkening  with a large telescope of or wider cloud patterns as well as some of the larger satellites such as titania and oberon  may be visible  uranus mass is roughly  times that of earth making it the least massive of the giant planets its diameter is slightly larger than neptune at roughly four times that of earth a resulting density of cm makes uranus the second least dense planet after saturn   this value indicates that it is made primarily of various ices such as water ammonia and methane  the total mass of ice in uranus interior is not precisely known because different figures emerge depending on the model chosen it must be between   masses   hydrogen and helium constitute only a small part of the total with between  and  masses  the remainder of the non-ice mass  to  masses is accounted for by rocky material   the standard model of uranus structure is that it consists of three layers a rocky  silicate  ironnickel  core in the centre an icy mantle in the middle and an outer gaseous hydrogenhelium envelope   the core is relatively small with a mass of only  masses and a radius less than  of uranus the mantle comprises its bulk with around  masses and the upper atmosphere is relatively insubstantial weighing about  masses and extending for the last  of uranus radius   uranus core density is around cm  with a pressure in the centre of bars  gpa  and a temperature of about k    the ice mantle is not in fact composed of ice in the conventional sense but of a hot and dense fluid consisting of water ammonia and other volatiles    this fluid which has a high electrical conductivity is sometimes called a waterammonia ocean  the extreme pressure and temperature deep within uranus may break up the methane molecules with the carbon atoms condensing into crystals of diamond that rain down through the mantle like hailstones    very-high-pressure experiments at the lawrence livermore national laboratory suggest that the base of the mantle may comprise an ocean of liquid diamond with floating solid -bergs   scientists also believe that rainfalls of solid diamonds occur on uranus as well as on jupiter  saturn  and neptune    the bulk compositions of uranus and neptune are different from those of jupiter and saturn  with ice dominating over gases hence justifying their separate classification as ice giants  there may be a layer of ionic water where the water molecules break down into a soup of hydrogen and oxygen ions and deeper down superionic water in which the oxygen crystallises but the hydrogen ions move freely within the oxygen lattice  although the model considered above is reasonably standard it is not unique other models also satisfy observations for instance if substantial amounts of hydrogen and rocky material are mixed in the ice mantle the total mass of ices in the interior will be lower and correspondingly the total mass of rocks and hydrogen will be higher presently available data does not allow a scientific determination of which model is correct  the fluid interior structure of uranus means that it has no solid surface the gaseous atmosphere gradually transitions into the internal liquid layers  for the sake of convenience a revolving oblate spheroid set at the point at which atmospheric pressure equals  kpa is conditionally designated as a surface it has equatorial and polar radii of   and   respectively  this surface is used throughout this article as a zero point for altitudes uranus internal heat appears markedly lower than that of the other giant planets in astronomical terms it has a low thermal flux    why uranus internal temperature is so low is still not understood neptune which is uranus near twin in size and composition radiates  times as much energy into space as it receives from the sun  but uranus radiates hardly any excess heat at all the total power radiated by uranus in the far infrared ie heat part of the spectrum is times the solar energy absorbed in its atmosphere    uranus heat flux is only w m  which is lower than the internal heat flux of earth of about w m   the lowest temperature recorded in uranus tropopause is   making uranus the coldest planet in the solar system   one of the hypotheses for this discrepancy suggests that when uranus was hit by a supermassive impactor which caused it to expel most of its primordial heat it was left with a depleted core temperature  this impact hypothesis is also used in some attempts to explain the planet axial tilt another hypothesis is that some form of barrier exists in uranus upper layers that prevents the core heat from reaching the surface  for example convection may take place in a set of compositionally different layers which may inhibit the upward heat transport    perhaps double diffusive convection is a limiting factor  in a recent study the ice giants interior conditions were mimicked by compressing water containing minerals like olivine and ferropericlase it showed that much magnesium could be dissolved in the liquid interiors of uranus and neptune a thermal insulation layer made of dissolved magnesium in uranus due to a larger quantity in uranus than neptune was proposed as a possible explanation of uranus low temperature  atmosphere of uranus  although there is no well-defined solid surface within uranus interior the outermost part of uranus gaseous envelope that is accessible to remote sensing is called its atmosphere   remote-sensing capability extends down to roughly below the  level with a corresponding pressure around  and temperature of    the tenuous thermosphere extends over two planetary radii from the nominal surface which is defined to lie at a pressure of bar  the uranian atmosphere can be divided into three layers the troposphere  between altitudes of and  and  and pressures from to   to  the stratosphere  spanning altitudes between and   and  and pressures of between  to pa  and the thermosphere extending from  to as high as  from the surface  there is no mesosphere  the composition of uranus atmosphere is different from its bulk consisting mainly of molecular hydrogen and helium  the helium molar fraction  ie the number of helium atoms per molecule of gas is  in the upper troposphere which corresponds to a mass fraction    this value is close to the protosolar helium mass fraction of   indicating that helium has not settled in its centre as it has in the gas giants  the third-most-abundant component of uranus atmosphere is methane    methane has prominent absorption bands in the visible and near-infrared ir making uranus aquamarine or cyan in colour  methane molecules account for  of the atmosphere by molar fraction below the methane cloud deck at the pressure level of   this represents about to the carbon abundance found in the sun    the mixing ratio i is much lower in the upper atmosphere due to its extremely low temperature which lowers the saturation level and causes excess methane to freeze out  the abundances of less volatile compounds such as ammonia water and hydrogen sulfide in the deep atmosphere are poorly known they are probably also higher than solar values   along with methane trace amounts of various hydrocarbons are found in the stratosphere of uranus which are thought to be produced from methane by photolysis induced by the solar ultraviolet uv radiation  they include ethane   acetylene   methylacetylene   and diacetylene      spectroscopy has also uncovered traces of water vapour carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide in the upper atmosphere which can only originate from an external source such as infalling dust and comets     the troposphere is the lowest and densest part of the atmosphere and is characterised by a decrease in temperature with altitude  the temperature falls from about   at the base of the nominal troposphere at to   at    the temperatures in the coldest upper region of the troposphere the tropopause  actually vary in the range between and  and  and  depending on planetary latitude   the tropopause region is responsible for the vast majority of uranus thermal far infrared emissions thus determining its effective temperature of      the troposphere is thought to have a highly complex cloud structure water clouds are hypothesised to lie in the pressure range of to  to  ammonium hydrosulfide clouds in the range of to  to  ammonia or hydrogen sulfide clouds at between and  and  and finally directly detected thin methane clouds at to  to      the troposphere is a dynamic part of the atmosphere exhibiting strong winds bright clouds and seasonal changes  hubble  the middle layer of the uranian atmosphere is the stratosphere  where temperature generally increases with altitude from   in the tropopause to between and  and  and  at the base of the thermosphere  the heating of the stratosphere is caused by absorption of solar uv and ir radiation by methane and other hydrocarbons   which form in this part of the atmosphere as a result of methane photolysis   heat is also conducted from the hot thermosphere  the hydrocarbons occupy a relatively narrow layer at altitudes of between and corresponding to a pressure range of to pa and temperatures of between and  and  and    the most abundant hydrocarbons are methane acetylene and ethane with mixing ratios of around relative to hydrogen the mixing ratio of carbon monoxide is similar at these altitudes    heavier hydrocarbons and carbon dioxide have mixing ratios three orders of magnitude lower  the abundance ratio of water is around   ethane and acetylene tend to condense in the colder lower part of stratosphere and tropopause below level forming haze layers  which may be partly responsible for the bland appearance of uranus the concentration of hydrocarbons in the uranian stratosphere above the haze is significantly lower than in the stratospheres of the other giant planets   the outermost layer of the uranian atmosphere is the thermosphere and corona which has a uniform temperature around to    the heat sources necessary to sustain such a high level are not understood as neither the solar uv nor the auroral activity can provide the necessary energy to maintain these temperatures the weak cooling efficiency due to the lack of hydrocarbons in the stratosphere above  pressure level may contribute too   in addition to molecular hydrogen the thermosphere-corona contains many free hydrogen atoms their small mass and high temperatures explain why the corona extends as far as   or two uranian radii from its surface   this extended corona is a unique feature of uranus  its effects include a drag on small particles orbiting uranus causing a general depletion of dust in the uranian rings  the uranian thermosphere together with the upper part of the stratosphere corresponds to the ionosphere of uranus  observations show that the ionosphere occupies altitudes from  to   to   the uranian ionosphere is denser than that of either saturn or neptune which may arise from the low concentration of hydrocarbons in the stratosphere   the ionosphere is mainly sustained by solar uv radiation and its density depends on the solar activity   auroral activity is insignificant as compared to jupiter and saturn   temperature profile of the uranian troposphere and lower stratosphere cloud and haze layers are also indicated zonal wind speeds on uranus shaded areas show the southern collar and its future northern counterpart the red curve is a symmetrical fit to the data before the arrival of  no measurements of the uranian magnetosphere had been taken so its nature remained a mystery before  scientists had expected the magnetic field of uranus to be in line with the solar wind  because it would then align with uranus poles that lie in the ecliptic   s observations revealed that uranus magnetic field is peculiar both because it does not originate from its geometric centre and because it is tilted at from the axis of rotation   in fact the magnetic dipole is shifted from uranus centre towards the south rotational pole by as much as one third of the planetary radius  this unusual geometry results in a highly asymmetric magnetosphere where the magnetic field strength on the surface in the southern hemisphere can be as low as  gauss  t  whereas in the northern hemisphere it can be as high as    the average field at the surface is    studies of data in suggest that this asymmetry causes uranus magnetosphere to connect with the solar wind once a uranian day opening the planet to the sun particles  in comparison the magnetic field of earth is roughly as strong at either pole and its magnetic equator is roughly parallel with its geographical equator  the dipole moment of uranus is that of earth   neptune has a similarly displaced and tilted magnetic field suggesting that this may be a common feature of ice giants  one hypothesis is that unlike the magnetic fields of the terrestrial and gas giants which are generated within their cores the ice giants magnetic fields are generated by motion at relatively shallow depths for instance in the waterammonia ocean   another possible explanation for the magnetosphere alignment is that there are oceans of liquid diamond in uranus interior that would deter the magnetic field  despite its curious alignment in other respects the uranian magnetosphere is like those of other planets it has a bow shock at about uranian radii ahead of it a magnetopause at uranian radii a fully developed magnetotail  and radiation belts     overall the structure of uranus magnetosphere is different from jupiter and more similar to saturn   uranus magnetotail trails behind it into space for millions of kilometres and is twisted by its sideways rotation into a long corkscrew   uranus magnetosphere contains charged particles  mainly protons and electrons  with a small amount of h ions    many of these particles probably derive from the thermosphere  the ion and electron energies can be as high as and  megaelectronvolts  respectively  the density of low-energy below kiloelectronvolt  ions in the inner magnetosphere is about   the particle population is strongly affected by the uranian moons which sweep through the magnetosphere leaving noticeable gaps  the particle flux is high enough to cause darkening or space weathering of their surfaces on an astronomically rapid timescale of   this may be the cause of the uniformly dark colouration of the uranian satellites and rings  uranus has relatively well developed aurorae which are seen as bright arcs around both magnetic poles  unlike jupiter uranus aurorae seem to be insignificant for the energy balance of the planetary thermosphere  in march  nasa astronomers reported the detection of a large atmospheric magnetic bubble also known as a plasmoid  released into outer space from the planet uranus after reevaluating old data recorded by the space probe during a flyby of the planet in    climate of uranus at ultraviolet and visible wavelengths uranus atmosphere is bland in comparison to the other giant planets even to neptune which it otherwise closely resembles  when flew by uranus in  it observed a total of ten cloud features across the entire planet   one proposed explanation for this dearth of features is that uranus internal heat appears markedly lower than that of the other giant planets the lowest temperature recorded in uranus tropopause is   making uranus the coldest planet in the solar system   in  found that the visible southern hemisphere of uranus can be subdivided into two regions a bright polar cap and dark equatorial bands  their boundary is located at about of latitude  a narrow band straddling the latitudinal range from to is the brightest large feature on its visible surface   it is called a southern collar the cap and collar are thought to be a dense region of methane clouds located within the pressure range of  to see above  besides the large-scale banded structure observed ten small bright clouds most lying several degrees to the north from the collar  in all other respects uranus looked like a dynamically dead planet in  arrived during the height of uranus southern summer and could not observe the northern hemisphere at the beginning of the century when the northern polar region came into view the hubble space telescope hst and keck telescope initially observed neither a collar nor a polar cap in the northern hemisphere  so uranus appeared to be asymmetric bright near the south pole and uniformly dark in the region north of the southern collar  in  when uranus passed its equinox the southern collar almost disappeared and a faint northern collar emerged near of latitude   acs in the  the number of the observed bright cloud features grew considerably partly because new high-resolution imaging techniques became available  most were found in the northern hemisphere as it started to become visible  an early explanationthat bright clouds are easier to identify in its dark part whereas in the southern hemisphere the bright collar masks them was shown to be incorrect   nevertheless there are differences between the clouds of each hemisphere the northern clouds are smaller sharper and brighter  they appear to lie at a higher altitude  the lifetime of clouds spans several orders of magnitude some small clouds live for hours at least one southern cloud may have persisted since the flyby   recent observation also discovered that cloud features on uranus have a lot in common with those on neptune  for example the dark spots common on neptune had never been observed on uranus before  when the first such feature dubbed uranus dark spot was imaged  the speculation is that uranus is becoming more neptune-like during its equinoctial season  the tracking of numerous cloud features allowed determination of zonal winds blowing in the upper troposphere of uranus  at the equator winds are retrograde which means that they blow in the reverse direction to the planetary rotation their speeds are from to h  to    wind speeds increase with the distance from the equator reaching zero values near latitude where the troposphere temperature minimum is located   closer to the poles the winds shift to a prograde direction flowing with uranus rotation wind speeds continue to increase reaching maxima at latitude before falling to zero at the poles  wind speeds at latitude range from to h  to  because the collar obscures all clouds below that parallel speeds between it and the southern pole are impossible to measure  in contrast in the northern hemisphere maximum speeds as high as h  are observed near  latitude    for a short period from march to may  large clouds appeared in the uranian atmosphere giving it a neptune-like appearance   observations included record-breaking wind speeds of h  and a persistent thunderstorm referred to as fourth of july fireworks  on august  reers at the space science institute boulder colorado and the university of wisconsin observed a dark spot on uranus surface giving scientists more insight into uranus atmospheric activity  why this sudden upsurge in activity occurred is not fully known but it appears that uranus extreme axial tilt results in extreme seasonal variations in its weather   determining the nature of this seasonal variation is difficult because good data on uranus atmosphere have existed for less than years or one full uranian year photometry over the course of half a uranian year beginning in the  has shown regular variation in the brightness in two spectral bands  with maxima occurring at the solstices and minima occurring at the equinoxes  a similar periodic variation with maxima at the solstices has been noted in microwave measurements of the deep troposphere begun in the   stratospheric temperature measurements beginning in the also showed maximum values near the solstice  the majority of this variability is thought to occur owing to changes in the viewing geometry  there are some indications that physical seasonal changes are happening in uranus although uranus is known to have a bright south polar region the north pole is fairly dim which is incompatible with the model of the seasonal change outlined above  during its previous northern solstice in  uranus displayed elevated levels of brightness which suggests that the north pole was not always so dim  this information implies that the visible pole brightens some time before the solstice and darkens after the equinox  detailed analysis of the visible and microwave data revealed that the periodical changes of brightness are not completely symmetrical around the solstices which also indicates a change in the meridional albedo patterns  in the  as uranus moved away from its solstice hubble and ground-based telescopes revealed that the south polar cap darkened noticeably except the southern collar which remained bright  whereas the northern hemisphere demonstrated increasing activity  such as cloud formations and stronger winds bolstering expectations that it should brighten soon  this indeed happened in when it passed an equinox a faint northern polar collar arose and the southern collar became nearly invisible although the zonal wind profile remained slightly asymmetric with northern winds being somewhat slower than southern  the mechanism of these physical changes is still not clear  near the summer and winter solstices uranus hemispheres lie alternately either in full glare of the sun rays or facing deep space the brightening of the sunlit hemisphere is thought to result from the local thickening of the methane clouds and haze layers located in the troposphere  the bright collar at latitude is also connected with methane clouds  other changes in the southern polar region can be explained by changes in the lower cloud layers  the variation of the microwave emission from uranus is probably caused by changes in the deep tropospheric circulation  because thick polar clouds and haze may inhibit convection  now that the spring and autumn equinoxes are arriving on uranus the dynamics are changing and convection can occur again   formation and evolution of the solar system nice model it is argued that the differences between the ice giants and the gas giants arise from their formation history    the solar system is hypothesised to have formed from a rotating disk of gas and dust known as the presolar nebula  much of the nebula gas primarily hydrogen and helium formed the sun and the dust grains collected together to form the first protoplanets as the planets grew some of them eventually accreted enough matter for their gravity to hold on to the nebula leftover gas    the more gas they held onto the larger they became the larger they became the more gas they held onto until a critical point was reached and their size began to increase exponentially  the ice giants with only a few earth masses of nebular gas never reached that critical point    recent simulations of planetary migration have suggested that both ice giants formed closer to the sun than their present positions and moved outwards after formation the nice model   moons of uranus timeline of discovery of solar system planets and their natural satellites albedos naco vlt uranus has known natural satellites   the names of these satellites are chosen from characters in the works of shakespeare and alexander pope    the five main satellites are miranda  ariel  umbriel  titania  and oberon   the uranian satellite system is the least massive among those of the giant planets the combined mass of the five major satellites would be less than half that of triton largest moon of neptune  alone  the largest of uranus satellites titania has a radius of only   or less than half that of the moon  but slightly more than rhea the second-largest satellite of saturn making titania the eighth-largest moon in the solar system uranus satellites have relatively low albedos ranging from  for umbriel to  for ariel in green light  they are icerock conglomerates composed of roughly  ice and  rock the ice may include ammonia and carbon dioxide    among the uranian satellites ariel appears to have the youngest surface with the fewest impact craters and umbriel the oldest   miranda has fault canyons  deep terraced layers and a chaotic variation in surface ages and features  miranda past geologic activity is thought to have been driven by tidal heating at a time when its orbit was more eccentric than currently probably as a result of a former  orbital resonance with umbriel  extensional processes associated with upwelling diapirs are the likely origin of miranda -like coronae    ariel is thought to have once been held in a  resonance with titania  uranus has at least one horseshoe orbiter occupying the sun uranus l lagrangian point a gravitationally unstable region at in its orbit crantor    crantor moves inside uranus co-orbital region on a complex temporary horseshoe orbit eu is also a promising uranus horseshoe librator candidate  rings of uranus the uranian rings are composed of extremely dark particles which vary in size from micrometres to a fraction of a metre  thirteen distinct rings are presently known the brightest being the ring all except two rings of uranus are extremely narrow they are usually a few kilometres wide the rings are probably quite young the dynamics considerations indicate that they did not form with uranus the matter in the rings may once have been part of a moon or moons that was shattered by high-speed impacts from numerous pieces of debris that formed as a result of those impacts only a few particles survived in stable zones corresponding to the locations of the present rings   william herschel described a possible ring around uranus in  this sighting is generally considered doubtful because the rings are quite faint and in the two following centuries none were noted by other observers still herschel made an accurate description of the epsilon ring size its angle relative to earth its red colour and its apparent changes as uranus travelled around the sun   the ring system was definitively discovered on march by james l elliot  edward w dunham and jessica mink using the kuiper airborne observatory  the discovery was serendipitous they planned to use the occultation of the star sao also known as hd  by uranus to study its atmosphere  when their observations were analysed they found that the star had disappeared briefly from view five times both before and after it disappeared behind uranus they concluded that there must be a ring system around uranus  later they detected four additional rings  the rings were directly imaged when passed uranus in   also discovered two additional faint rings bringing the total number to eleven  in december  the hubble space telescope detected a pair of previously unknown rings the largest is located twice as far from uranus as the previously known rings these new rings are so far from uranus that they are called the outer ring system hubble also spotted two small satellites one of which mab  shares its orbit with the outermost newly discovered ring the new rings bring the total number of uranian rings to   in april  images of the new rings from the keck observatory yielded the colours of the outer rings the outermost is blue and the other one red   one hypothesis concerning the outer ring blue colour is that it is composed of minute particles of water ice from the surface of mab that are small enough to scatter blue light   in contrast uranus inner rings appear grey  animation about the discovering occultation in  click on it to start uranus has a complicated planetary ring system which was the second such system to be discovered in the solar system after saturn   uranus aurorae against its equatorial rings imaged by the hubble telescope unlike the aurorae of earth and jupiter those of uranus are not in line with its poles due to its lopsided magnetic field exploration of uranus in  nasa interplanetary probe encountered uranus this flyby remains the only investigation of uranus carried out from a short distance and no other visits are planned launched in  made its closest approach to uranus on january  coming within   of the cloudtops before continuing its journey to neptune the spacecraft studied the structure and chemical composition of uranus atmosphere  including its unique weather caused by its axial tilt of  it made the first detailed investigations of its five largest moons and discovered new ones voyager examined all nine of the system known rings and discovered two more    it also studied the magnetic field its irregular structure its tilt and its unique corkscrew magnetotail caused by uranus sideways orientation  voyager was unable to visit uranus because investigation of saturn moon titan was considered a priority this trajectory took out of the plane of the ecliptic  ending its planetary science mission  the possibility of sending the spacecraft from saturn to uranus was evaluated during a mission extension planning phase in  but was ultimately rejected in favour of destroying it in the saturnian atmosphere  it would have taken about twenty years to get to the uranian system after departing saturn  a uranus orbiter and probe was recommended by the planetary science decadal survey published in  the proposal envisages launch during and a -year cruise to uranus  a uranus entry probe could use pioneer venus multiprobe heritage and descend to atmospheres  the esa evaluated a medium-class mission called uranus pathfinder   a new frontiers uranus orbiter has been evaluated and recommended in the study   such a mission is aided by the ease

composition by volume gases hydrogen helium methane hydrogen deuteride ethane ices ammonia water ammonium hydrosulfide methane ice neptune is the eighth and farthest-known solar planet from the sun  in the solar system  it is the fourth-largest planet by diameter the third-most-massive planet and the densest giant planet  it is times the mass of earth  slightly more massive than its near-twin uranus  neptune is denser and physically smaller than uranus because its greater mass causes more gravitational compression of its atmosphere the planet orbits the sun once every  years at an average distance of  au   it is named after the roman god of the sea and has the astronomical symbol  a stylised version of the god neptune trident  neptune is not visible to the unaided eye and is the only planet in the solar system found by mathematical prediction rather than by empirical observation  unexpected changes in the orbit of uranus led alexis bouvard to deduce that its orbit was subject to gravitational perturbation by an unknown planet after bouvard death the position of neptune was predicted from his observations independently by john couch adams and urbain le verrier  neptune was subsequently observed with a telescope on september  by johann galle within a degree of the position predicted by le verrier its largest moon triton  was discovered shortly thereafter though none of the planet remaining known moons were located telescopically until the century the planet distance from earth gives it a very small apparent size making it challenging to study with earth-based telescopes neptune was visited by voyager  when it flew by the planet on august  remains the only spacecraft to visit neptune   the advent of the hubble space telescope and large ground-based telescopes with adaptive optics has recently allowed for additional detailed observations from afar like jupiter and saturn neptune atmosphere is composed primarily of hydrogen and helium  along with traces of hydrocarbons and possibly nitrogen  though it contains a higher proportion of ices such as water ammonia and methane  however similar to uranus its interior is primarily composed of ices and rock  uranus and neptune are normally considered  ice giants  to emphasise this distinction  traces of methane in the outermost regions in part account for the planet blue appearance  though an unknown component is believed to color neptune a deeper blue compared to uranus  in contrast to the hazy relatively featureless atmosphere of uranus neptune atmosphere has active and visible weather patterns for example at the time of the flyby in  the planet southern hemisphere had a great dark spot comparable to the great red spot on jupiter more recently in  a newer main dark spot and smaller dark spot were identified and studied  in addition these weather patterns are driven by the strongest sustained winds of any planet in the solar system with recorded wind speeds as high as h s   because of its great distance from the sun neptune outer atmosphere is one of the coldest places in the solar system with temperatures at its cloud tops approaching k  c  f  temperatures at the planet centre are approximately      neptune has a faint and fragmented ring system labelled arcs which was discovered in  then later confirmed by   contents discovery of neptune galileo galilei some of the earliest recorded observations ever made through a telescope  galileo drawings on december and january contain plotted points that match up with what is now known to be the position of neptune on both occasions galileo seems to have mistaken neptune for a fixed star when it appeared closein conjunction to jupiter in the night sky   hence he is not credited with neptune discovery at his first observation in december  neptune was almost stationary in the sky because it had just turned retrograde that day this apparent backward motion is created when earth orbit takes it past an outer planet because neptune was only beginning its yearly retrograde cycle the motion of the planet was far too slight to be detected with galileo small telescope  in  a study suggested that galileo was at least aware that the star he had observed had moved relative to the fixed stars   in  alexis bouvard published astronomical tables of the orbit of neptune neighbour uranus   subsequent observations revealed substantial deviations from the tables leading bouvard to hypothesise that an unknown body was perturbing the orbit through gravitational interaction  in  john couch adams began work on the orbit of uranus using the data he had he requested extra data from sir george airy  the astronomer royal  who supplied it in february  adams continued to work in and produced several different estimates of a new planet   urbain le verrier in  urbain le verrier  independently of adams developed his own calculations but aroused no enthusiasm in his compatriots in june  upon seeing le verrier first published estimate of the planet longitude and its similarity to adams estimate airy persuaded james challis to  for the planet challis vainly scoured the sky throughout august and september   meanwhile le verrier sent a letter and urged berlin observatory astronomer johann gottfried galle to  with the observatory refractor  heinrich d  a student at the observatory suggested to galle that they could compare a recently drawn chart of the sky in the region of le verrier predicted location with the current sky to seek the displacement characteristic of a planet  as opposed to a fixed star on the evening of september  the day galle received the letter he discovered neptune just northeast of iota aquarii  from the   position le verrier had predicted it to be   about from adams prediction and on the border of aquarius and capricornus according to the modern iau constellation boundaries challis later realised that he had observed the planet twice on and august but did not recognise it as a planet because he lacked an up-to-date star map and was distracted by his concurrent work on comet observations   in the wake of the discovery there was a heated nationalistic rivalry between the french and the british over who deserved credit for the discovery eventually an international consensus emerged that le verrier and adams deserved joint credit since  dennis rawlins has questioned the credibility of adams claim to co-discovery and the issue was re-evaluated by historians with the return in of the neptune papers historical documents to the royal observatory greenwich    shortly after its discovery neptune was referred to simply as the planet exterior to uranus or as le verrier planet the first suggestion for a name came from galle who proposed the name janus  in england challis put forward the name oceanus   claiming the right to name his discovery le verrier quickly proposed the name for this new planet though falsely stating that this had been officially approved by the french bureau des longitudes   in october he sought to name the planet  after himself and he had loyal support in this from the observatory director franois arago  this suggestion met with stiff resistance outside france  french almanacs quickly reintroduced the name for uranus after that planet discoverer sir william herschel  and for the new planet  struve came out in favour of the name on december  to the saint petersburg academy of sciences   soon became the internationally accepted name in roman mythology  neptune was the god of the sea identified with the greek poseidon  the demand for a mythological name seemed to be in keeping with the nomenclature of the other planets all of which except for earth were named for deities in greek and roman mythology  most languages today use some variant of the name neptune for the planet indeed in chinese vietnamese japanese and korean the planet name was translated as sea king star     in mongolian  neptune is called   reflecting its namesake god role as the ruler of the sea in modern greek the planet is called    the greek counterpart of neptune  in hebrew    from a biblical sea monster mentioned in the book of psalms  was selected in a vote managed by the academy of the hebrew language in as the official name for the planet even though the existing latin term   is commonly used   in mori  the planet is called  named after the mori god of the sea   in nahuatl  the planet is called  named after the rain god tlloc   in thai  neptune is referred both by its westernised name   and is also named   of ketu after ketu   the descending lunar node  who plays a role in hindu astrology  in malay  the name  after the hindu god of seas  was attested as far as the  until it was eventually superseded by the latinate equivalent either as in malaysian   or in indonesian   the usual adjectival form is  the nonce form     from poseidon  has also been used  though the usual adjectival form of poseidon is      from its discovery in until the discovery of pluto in  neptune was the farthest-known planet when pluto was discovered it was considered a planet and neptune thus became the second-farthest-known planet except for a -year period between and when pluto elliptical orbit brought it closer than neptune to the sun  the discovery of the kuiper belt in led many astronomers to debate whether pluto should be considered a planet or as part of the kuiper belt   in  the international astronomical union defined the word planet for the first time  reclassifying pluto as a  dwarf planet  and making neptune once again the outermost-known planet in the solar system  neptune mass of  kg  is intermediate between earth and the larger gas giants  it is times that of earth but just  that of jupiter  d its gravity at bar is s   times the surface gravity of earth  and surpassed only by jupiter  neptune equatorial radius of   is nearly four times that of earth neptune like uranus  is an ice giant  a subclass of giant planet  because they are smaller and have higher concentrations of volatiles than jupiter and saturn   in the  for extrasolar planets  neptune has been used as a metonym  discovered bodies of similar mass are often referred to as neptunes  just as scientists refer to various extrasolar bodies as jupiters extraterrestrial diamonds neptune internal structure resembles that of uranus  its atmosphere forms about  to  of its mass and extends perhaps  to  of the way towards the core where it reaches pressures of about gpa  or about  times that of earth atmosphere increasing concentrations of methane  ammonia and water are found in the lower regions of the atmosphere  the mantle is equivalent to to earth masses and is rich in water ammonia and methane  as is customary in planetary science this mixture is referred to as icy even though it is a hot dense fluid this fluid which has a high electrical conductivity is sometimes called a waterammonia ocean  the mantle may consist of a layer of ionic water in which the water molecules break down into a soup of hydrogen and oxygen ions  and deeper down superionic water in which the oxygen crystallises but the hydrogen ions float around freely within the oxygen lattice  at a depth of  the conditions may be such that methane decomposes into diamond crystals that rain downwards like hailstones    scientists also believe that this kind of diamond rain occurs on jupiter  saturn  and uranus    very-high-pressure experiments at the lawrence livermore national laboratory suggest that the top of the mantle may be an ocean of liquid carbon with floating solid     the core of neptune is likely composed of iron nickel and silicates  with an interior model giving a mass about  times that of earth  the pressure at the centre is mbar  gpa about twice as high as that at the centre of earth and the temperature may be    infrared methane atmosphere moons proteus larissa galatea despina at high altitudes neptune atmosphere is  hydrogen and  helium   a trace amount of methane is also present prominent absorption bands of methane exist at wavelengths above  in the red and infrared portion of the spectrum as with uranus this absorption of red light by the atmospheric methane is part of what gives neptune its blue hue  although neptune vivid azure differs from uranus milder cyan  because neptune atmospheric methane content is similar to that of uranus some unknown atmospheric constituent is thought to contribute to neptune colour  neptune atmosphere is subdivided into two main regions the lower troposphere  where temperature decreases with altitude and the stratosphere  where temperature increases with altitude the boundary between the two the tropopause  lies at a pressure of  bars   the stratosphere then gives way to the thermosphere at a pressure lower than to bars  to   the thermosphere gradually transitions to the exosphere  models suggest that neptune troposphere is banded by clouds of varying compositions depending on altitude the upper-level clouds lie at pressures below one bar where the temperature is suitable for methane to condense for pressures between one and five bars  and kpa clouds of ammonia and hydrogen sulfide are thought to form above a pressure of five bars the clouds may consist of ammonia ammonium sulfide  hydrogen sulfide and water deeper clouds of water ice should be found at pressures of about bars  where the temperature reaches  underneath clouds of ammonia and hydrogen sulfide may be found  high-altitude clouds on neptune have been observed casting shadows on the opaque cloud deck below there are also high-altitude cloud bands that wrap around the planet at constant latitude these circumferential bands have widths of and lie about above the cloud deck  these altitudes are in the layer where weather occurs the troposphere weather does not occur in the higher stratosphere or thermosphere neptune spectra suggest that its lower stratosphere is hazy due to condensation of products of ultraviolet photolysis of methane such as ethane and ethyne    the stratosphere is also home to trace amounts of carbon monoxide and hydrogen cyanide    the stratosphere of neptune is warmer than that of uranus due to the elevated concentration of hydrocarbons  for reasons that remain obscure the planet thermosphere is at an anomalously high temperature of about    the planet is too far from the sun for this heat to be generated by ultraviolet radiation one candidate for a heating mechanism is atmospheric interaction with ions in the planet magnetic field  other candidates are gravity waves from the interior that dissipate in the atmosphere the thermosphere contains traces of carbon dioxide and water which may have been deposited from external sources such as meteorites and dust   neptune resembles uranus in its magnetosphere  with a magnetic field strongly tilted relative to its rotational axis at and offset at least  or about  from the planet physical centre before arrival at neptune it was hypothesised that uranus tilted magnetosphere was the result of its sideways rotation in comparing the magnetic fields of the two planets scientists now think the extreme orientation may be characteristic of flows in the planets interiors this field may be generated by convective fluid motions in a thin spherical shell of electrically conducting liquids probably a combination of ammonia methane and water  resulting in a dynamo action  the dipole component of the magnetic field at the magnetic equator of neptune is about microteslas  g   the dipole magnetic moment of neptune is about  tm   where is the radius of neptune neptune magnetic field has a complex geometry that includes relatively large contributions from non-dipolar components including a strong quadrupole moment that may exceed the dipole moment in strength by contrast earth jupiter and saturn have only relatively small quadrupole moments and their fields are less tilted from the polar axis the large quadrupole moment of neptune may be the result of offset from the planet centre and geometrical constraints of the field dynamo generator   neptune bow shock  where the magnetosphere begins to slow the solar wind  occurs at a distance of  times the radius of the planet the magnetopause  where the pressure of the magnetosphere counterbalances the solar wind lies at a distance of  times the radius of neptune the tail of the magnetosphere extends out to at least times the radius of neptune and likely much farther  great dark spot  small dark spot neptune weather is characterised by extremely dynamic storm systems with winds reaching speeds of almost s h nearly reaching supersonic flow  more typically by tracking the motion of persistent clouds wind speeds have been shown to vary from s in the easterly direction to s westward  at the cloud tops the prevailing winds range in speed from s along the equator to s at the poles  most of the winds on neptune move in a direction opposite the planet rotation  the general pattern of winds showed prograde rotation at high latitudes vs retrograde rotation at lower latitudes the difference in flow direction is thought to be a skin effect and not due to any deeper atmospheric processes  at s latitude a high-speed jet travels at a speed of s  neptune differs from uranus in its typical level of meteorological activity observed weather phenomena on neptune during its flyby  but no comparable phenomena on uranus during its fly-by the abundance of methane ethane and acetylene at neptune equator is times greater than at the poles this is interpreted as evidence for upwelling at the equator and subsidence near the poles because photochemistry cannot account for the distribution without meridional circulation  in  it was discovered that the upper troposphere of neptune south pole was about k warmer than the rest of its atmosphere which averages approximately  the temperature differential is enough to let methane which elsewhere is frozen in the troposphere escape into the stratosphere near the pole  the relative hot spot is due to neptune axial tilt  which has exposed the south pole to the sun for the last quarter of neptune year or roughly earth years as neptune slowly moves towards the opposite side of the sun the south pole will be darkened and the north pole illuminated causing the methane release to shift to the north pole  because of seasonal changes the cloud bands in the southern hemisphere of neptune have been observed to increase in size and albedo  this trend was first seen in and is expected to last until about  the long orbital period of neptune results in seasons lasting forty years  in  the great dark spot  an anticyclonic storm system spanning      was discovered by nasa spacecraft the storm resembled the great red spot of jupiter some five years later on november  the hubble space telescope did not see the great dark spot on the planet instead a new storm similar to the great dark spot was found in neptune northern hemisphere  the is another storm a white cloud group farther south than the great dark spot this nickname first arose during the months leading up to the encounter in  when they were observed moving at speeds faster than the great dark spot and images acquired later would subsequently reveal the presence of clouds moving even faster than those that had initially been detected by   the small dark spot is a southern cyclonic storm the second-most-intense storm observed during the encounter it was initially completely dark but as approached the planet a bright core developed and can be seen in most of the highest-resolution images  more recently in  a newer main dark spot and smaller dark spot were identified and studied  neptune dark spots are thought to occur in the troposphere at lower altitudes than the brighter cloud features  so they appear as holes in the upper cloud decks as they are stable features that can persist for several months they are thought to be vortex structures  often associated with dark spots are brighter persistent methane clouds that form around the tropopause layer  the persistence of companion clouds shows that some former dark spots may continue to exist as cyclones even though they are no longer visible as a dark feature dark spots may dissipate when they migrate too close to the equator or possibly through some other unknown mechanism  the appearance of a northern great dark spot in is evidence of a huge storm brewing  the northern great dark spot and a smaller companion storm imaged by hubble in  the great dark spot as imaged by neptune shrinking vortex   neptune more varied weather when compared to uranus is due in part to its higher internal heating  the upper regions of neptune troposphere reach a low temperature of   at a depth where the atmospheric pressure equals bar  kpa  the temperature is    deeper inside the layers of gas the temperature rises steadily as with uranus the source of this heating is unknown but the discrepancy is larger uranus only radiates  times as much energy as it receives from the sun  whereas neptune radiates about  times as much energy as it receives from the sun  neptune is the farthest planet from the sun and lies over  farther from the sun than uranus and receives only  its amount of sunlight  yet its internal energy is sufficient to drive the fastest planetary winds seen in the solar system depending on the thermal properties of its interior the heat left over from neptune formation may be sufficient to explain its current heat flow though it is more difficult to simultaneously explain uranus lack of internal heat while preserving the apparent similarity between the two planets  the average distance between neptune and the sun is about  astronomical units au and it completes an orbit on average every  subject to a variability of around  the perihelion distance is  the aphelion distance is   on july  neptune completed its first full barycentric orbit since its discovery in    although it did not appear at its exact discovery position in the sky because earth was in a different location in its -day orbit because of the motion of the sun in relation to the barycentre of the solar system on july neptune was also not at its exact discovery position in relation to the sun if the more common heliocentric coordinate system is used the discovery longitude was reached on july     the elliptical orbit of neptune is inclined  compared to that of earth the axial tilt of neptune is   which is similar to the tilts of earth  and mars  as a result neptune experiences similar seasonal changes to earth the long orbital period of neptune means that the seasons last for forty earth years  its sidereal rotation period day is roughly   because its axial tilt is comparable to earth the variation in the length of its day over the course of its long year is not any more extreme because neptune is not a solid body its atmosphere undergoes differential rotation  the wide equatorial zone rotates with a period of about  which is slower than the -hour rotation of the planet magnetic field by contrast the reverse is true for the polar regions where the rotation period is  this differential rotation is the most pronounced of any planet in the solar system  and it results in strong latitudinal wind shear  kuiper belt resonant trans-neptunian object neptune trojan kuiper belt classical belt twotinos neptune orbit has a profound impact on the region directly beyond it known as the kuiper belt  the kuiper belt is a ring of small icy worlds similar to the asteroid belt but far larger extending from neptune orbit at out to about from the sun  much in the same way that jupiter gravity dominates the asteroid belt shaping its structure so neptune gravity dominates the kuiper belt over the age of the solar system certain regions of the kuiper belt became destabilised by neptune gravity creating gaps in the kuiper belt structure the region between and is an example  there do exist orbits within these empty regions where objects can survive for the age of the solar system these resonances occur when neptune orbital period is a precise fraction of that of the object such as  or  if say an object orbits the sun once for every two neptune orbits it will only complete half an orbit by the time neptune returns to its original position the most heavily populated resonance in the kuiper belt with over known objects  is the  resonance objects in this resonance complete orbits for every of neptune and are known as plutinos because the largest of the known kuiper belt objects pluto  is among them  although pluto crosses neptune orbit regularly the  resonance ensures they can never collide  the    and  resonances are less populated  neptune has a number of known trojan objects occupying both the sun neptune l and l lagrangian points gravitationally stable regions leading and trailing neptune in its orbit respectively  neptune trojans can be viewed as being in a  resonance with neptune some neptune trojans are remarkably stable in their orbits and are likely to have formed alongside neptune rather than being captured the first object identified as associated with neptune trailing l lagrangian point was lc   neptune also has a temporary quasi-satellite   rw   the object has been a quasi-satellite of neptune for about  years and it will remain in that dynamical state for another  years  formation and evolution of the solar system nice model the formation of the ice giants neptune and uranus has proven difficult to model precisely current models suggest that the matter density in the outer regions of the solar system was too low to account for the formation of such large bodies from the traditionally accepted method of core accretion  and various hypotheses have been advanced to explain their formation one is that the ice giants were not formed by core accretion but from instabilities within the original protoplanetary disc and later had their atmospheres blasted away by radiation from a nearby massive ob star   an alternative concept is that they formed closer to the sun where the matter density was higher and then subsequently migrated to their current orbits after the removal of the gaseous protoplanetary disc  this hypothesis of migration after formation is favoured due to its ability to better explain the occupancy of the populations of small objects observed in the trans-neptunian region  the current most widely accepted    explanation of the details of this hypothesis is known as the nice model  which explores the effect of a migrating neptune and the other giant planets on the structure of the kuiper belt moons of neptune timeline of discovery of solar system planets and their moons hubble space telescope neptune has known moons    triton is the largest neptunian moon comprising more than  of the mass in orbit around neptune e and it is the only one massive enough to be spheroidal  triton was discovered by william lassell just after the discovery of neptune itself unlike all other large planetary moons in the solar system triton has a retrograde orbit  indicating that it was captured rather than forming in place it was probably once a dwarf planet in the kuiper belt  it is close enough to neptune to be locked into a synchronous rotation  and it is slowly spiralling inward because of tidal acceleration  it will eventually be torn apart in about  years when it reaches the roche limit   in  triton was the coldest object that had yet been measured in the solar system  with estimated temperatures of   neptune second-known satellite by order of discovery the irregular moon nereid  has one of the most eccentric orbits of any satellite in the solar system the eccentricity of  gives it an apoapsis that is seven times its periapsis distance from neptune f proteus from july to september  discovered six moons of neptune  of these the irregularly shaped proteus is notable for being as large as a body of its density can be without being pulled into a spherical shape by its own gravity  although the second-most-massive neptunian moon it is only  the mass of triton neptune innermost four moons naiad  thalassa  despina and galatea orbit close enough to be within neptune rings the next-farthest out larissa  was originally discovered in when it had occulted a star this occultation had been attributed to ring arcs but when observed neptune in  larissa was found to have caused it five new irregular moons discovered between and were announced in    a new moon and the smallest yet hippocamp  was found in by combining multiple hubble images  because neptune was the roman god of the sea neptune moons have been named after lesser sea gods  rings of neptune neptune has a planetary ring system though one much less substantial than that of saturn  the rings may consist of ice particles coated with silicates or carbon-based material which most likely gives them a reddish hue  the three main rings are the narrow adams ring  from the centre of neptune the le verrier ring at  and the broader fainter galle ring at  a faint outward extension to the le verrier ring has been named lassell it is bounded at its outer edge by the arago ring at   the first of these planetary rings was detected in by a team led by edward guinan    in the early  analysis of this data along with newer observations led to the hypothesis that this ring might be incomplete  evidence that the rings might have gaps first arose during a stellar occultation in when the rings obscured a star on immersion but not on emersion  images from in settled the issue by showing several faint rings the outermost ring adams contains five prominent arcs now named    and courage liberty equality and fraternity  the existence of arcs was difficult to explain because the laws of motion would predict that arcs would spread out into a uniform ring over short timescales astronomers now estimate that the arcs are corralled into their current form by the gravitational effects of galatea  a moon just inward from the ring   earth-based observations announced in appeared to show that neptune rings are much more unstable than previously thought images taken from the w m keck observatory in and show considerable decay in the rings when compared to images by  in particular it seems that the arc might disappear in as little as one century  european southern observatory neptune brightened significantly between and   the apparent magnitude currently ranges from  to  with a mean of  and a standard deviation of   prior to the planet was as faint as magnitude   neptune is too faint to be visible to the naked eye and can be outshone by jupiter galilean moons  the dwarf planet ceres and the asteroids vesta  pallas  iris  juno  and hebe   a telescope or strong binoculars will resolve neptune as a small blue disk similar in appearance to uranus  because of the distance of neptune from earth its angular diameter only ranges from  to  arcseconds    the smallest of the solar system planets its small apparent size makes it challenging to study visually most telescopic data was fairly limited until the advent of the hubble space telescope and large ground-based telescopes with adaptive optics ao    the first scientifically useful observation of neptune from ground-based telescopes using adaptive optics was commenced in from hawaii  neptune is currently entering its spring and summer season and has been shown to be heating up with increased atmospheric activity and brightness as a consequence combined with technological advancements ground-based telescopes with adaptive optics are recording increasingly more detailed images of it both and the adaptive-optics telescopes on earth have made many new discoveries within the solar system since the mid- with a large increase in the number of known satellites and moons around the outer planet among others in and  five new small satellites of neptune with diameters between and kilometres were discovered  from earth neptune goes through apparent retrograde motion every  resulting in a looping motion against the background stars during each opposition  these loops carried it close to the discovery coordinates in april and july and again in october and november   neptune year orbital period means that the planet takes an average of years to move through each constellation of the zodiac in  it completed its first full orbit of the sun since being discovered and returned to where it was first spotted northeast of iota aquarii  observation of neptune in the radio-frequency band shows that it is a source of both continuous emission and irregular bursts both sources are thought to originate from its rotating magnetic field  in the infrared part of the spectrum neptune storms appear bright against the cooler background allowing the size and shape of these features to be readily tracked  exploration of neptune voyager is the only spacecraft that has visited neptune the spacecraft closest approach to the planet occurred on august  because this was the last major planet the spacecraft could visit it was decided to make a close flyby of the moon triton regardless of the consequences to the trajectory similarly to what was done for voyager s encounter with saturn and its moon titan  the images relayed back to earth from became the basis of a pbs all-night program   during the encounter signals from the spacecraft required to reach earth hence for the most part mission relied on preloaded commands for the neptune encounter the spacecraft performed a near-encounter with the moon nereid before it came within  of neptune atmosphere on august then passed close to the planet largest moon triton later the same day  the spacecraft verified the existence of a magnetic field surrounding the planet and discovered that the field was offset from the centre and tilted in a manner similar to the field around uranus neptune rotation period was determined using measurements of radio emissions and also showed that neptune had a surprisingly active weather system six new moons were discovered and the planet was shown to have more than one ring   the flyby also provided the first accurate measurement of neptune mass which was found to be  percent less than previously calculated the new figure disproved the hypothesis that an undiscovered planet x acted upon the orbits of neptune and uranus   after the flyby mission the next step in scientific exploration of the neptunian system is considered to be a flagship orbital mission   such a hypothetical mission is envisioned to be possible in the late or early   however there have been discussions to launch neptune missions sooner in  there was a proposal in nasa vision missions studies for a  neptune orbiter with probes  mission that does cassini -level science  another more recent proposal was for argo  a flyby spacecraft to be launched in  that would visit jupiter  saturn  neptune and a kuiper belt object  the focus would be on neptune and its largest moon triton to be investigated around   the proposed new horizons mission which was later scrapped might also have done a close flyby of the neptunian system currently a pending proposal for the discovery program  the would conduct a flyby of neptune and triton  neptune odyssey is the current mission concept for a neptune orbiter and atmospheric probe

milky way galaxy disambiguation ngc spiral galaxy constellation coma berenices light-years a galaxy is a gravitationally bound system of stars  stellar remnants  interstellar gas  dust  and dark matter    the word galaxy is derived from the greek   literally milky a reference to the milky way  galaxies range in size from dwarfs with just a few hundred million   stars to giants with one hundred trillion   stars  each orbiting its galaxy center of mass  galaxies are categorized according to their visual morphology as elliptical   spiral  or irregular   many galaxies are thought to have supermassive black holes at their centers the milky way central black hole known as sagittarius a  has a mass four million times greater than the sun   as of march  gn- is the oldest and most distant galaxy observed it has a comoving distance of billion light-years from earth  and is seen as it existed just million years after the big bang  in  data from nasa new horizons space probe was used to revise the previous estimate of trillion galaxies down to roughly billion galaxies    this followed a estimate that there were two trillion   or more   galaxies in the observable universe  overall as many as an estimated stars   more stars than all the grains of sand on planet earth   most of the galaxies are  to  parsecs in diameter approximately  to  light years  and are separated by distances on the order of millions of parsecs or megaparsecs for comparison the milky way has a diameter of at least  parsecs  ly and is separated from the andromeda galaxy  its nearest large neighbor by  parsecs  million ly the space between galaxies is filled with a tenuous gas the intergalactic medium  having an average density of less than one atom per cubic meter the majority of galaxies are gravitationally organized into groups  clusters  and superclusters  the milky way is part of the local group  which it dominates along with andromeda galaxy  the group is part of the virgo supercluster  at the largest scale  these associations are generally arranged into sheets and filaments surrounded by immense voids   both the local group and the virgo supercluster are contained in a much larger cosmic structure named laniakea   contents the word was borrowed via french and medieval latin from the greek term for the milky way     circle named after its appearance as a milky band of light in the sky in greek mythology  zeus places his son born by a mortal woman the infant heracles  on hera breast while she is asleep so the baby will drink her divine milk and thus become immortal hera wakes up while breastfeeding and then realizes she is nursing an unknown baby she pushes the baby away some of her milk spills and it produces the band of light known as the milky way   in the astronomical literature the capitalized word galaxy is often used to refer to our galaxy the milky way  to distinguish it from the other galaxies in our universe  the english term can be traced back to a story by chaucer  see yonder lo the galaxy which men clepeth  for hit is whyt the house of fame  galaxies were initially discovered telescopically and were known as spiral nebulae  most to century astronomers considered them as either unresolved star clusters or anagalactic nebulae  and were just thought of as a part of the milky way but their true composition and natures remained a mystery observations using larger telescopes of a few nearby bright galaxies like the andromeda galaxy  began resolving them into huge conglomerations of stars but based simply on the apparent faintness and sheer population of stars the true distances of these objects placed them well beyond the milky way for this reason they were popularly called  but this term quickly fell into disuse as the word implied the entirety of existence instead they became known simply as galaxies  galaxy cluster sdss  sloan digital sky survey julian epoch declination right ascension tens of thousands of galaxies have been catalogued but only a few have well-established names such as the andromeda galaxy  the magellanic clouds  the whirlpool galaxy  and the sombrero galaxy  astronomers work with numbers from certain catalogues such as the messier catalogue  the ngc  new general catalogue  the ic  index catalogue  the cgcg  catalogue of galaxies and of clusters of galaxies  the mcg  morphological catalogue of galaxies  and ugc  uppsala general catalogue of galaxies all the well-known galaxies appear in one or more of these catalogues but each time under a different number
for example messier is a spiral galaxy having the number in the catalogue of messier and also having the designations ngc  ugc  cgcg - mcg -- and pgc  the realization that we live in a galaxy that is one among many galaxies parallels major discoveries that were made about the milky way and other nebulae  milky way the greek philosopher democritus  bce proposed that the bright band on the night sky known as the milky way might consist of distant stars  aristotle  bce however believed the milky way to be caused by the ignition of the fiery exhalation of some stars that were large numerous and close together and that the ignition takes place in the upper part of the atmosphere  in the region of the world that is continuous with the heavenly motions   the neoplatonist philosopher olympiodorus the younger  ce was critical of this view arguing that if the milky way is sublunary situated between earth and the moon it should appear different at different times and places on earth and that it should have parallax  which it does not in his view the milky way is celestial  according to mohani mohamed the arabian astronomer alhazen  made the first attempt at observing and measuring the milky way parallax  and he thus determined that because the milky way had no parallax it must be remote from the earth not belonging to the atmosphere  the persian astronomer al-brn  proposed the milky way galaxy to be a collection of countless fragments of the nature of nebulous stars  the andalusian astronomer ibn bjjah avempace  proposed that the milky way is made up of many stars that almost touch one another and appear to be a continuous image due to the effect of refraction from sublunary material   citing his observation of the conjunction of jupiter and mars as evidence of this occurring when two objects are near  in the century the syrian-born ibn qayyim proposed the milky way galaxy to be a myriad of tiny stars packed together in the sphere of the fixed stars  william herschel actual proof of the milky way consisting of many stars came in when the italian astronomer galileo galilei used a telescope to study the milky way and discovered that it is composed of a huge number of faint stars   in the english astronomer thomas wright  in his  speculated correctly that the galaxy might be a rotating body of a huge number of stars held together by gravitational forces akin to the solar system but on a much larger scale the resulting disk of stars can be seen as a band on the sky from our perspective inside the disk   in a treatise in  immanuel kant elaborated on wright idea about the structure of the milky way  the first project to describe the shape of the milky way and the position of the sun was undertaken by william herschel in by counting the number of stars in different regions of the sky he produced a diagram of the shape of the galaxy with the solar system close to the center    using a refined approach kapteyn in arrived at the picture of a small diameter about  ellipsoid galaxy with the sun close to the center a different method by harlow shapley based on the cataloguing of globular clusters led to a radically different picture a flat disk with diameter approximately and the sun far from the center  both analyses failed to take into account the absorption of light by interstellar dust present in the galactic plane  but after robert julius trumpler quantified this effect in by studying open clusters  the present picture of our host galaxy the milky way emerged  a few galaxies outside the milky way are visible on a dark night to the unaided eye  including the andromeda galaxy  large magellanic cloud  the small magellanic cloud  and the triangulum galaxy  in the century the persian astronomer al-sufi made the earliest recorded identification of the andromeda galaxy describing it as a small cloud  in  al-sufi probably mentioned the large magellanic cloud in his book of fixed stars referring to al bakr of the southern arabs  since at a declination of about south it was not visible where he lived it was not well known to europeans until magellan voyage in the century   the andromeda galaxy was later independently noted by simon marius in   in  philosopher emanuel swedenborg in his speculated that there may be galaxies outside our own that are formed into galactic clusters that are minuscule parts of the universe that extends far beyond what we can see these views are remarkably close to the present-day views of the cosmos  in  pierre louis maupertuis conjectured that some nebula -like objects are collections of stars with unique properties including a glow exceeding the light its stars produce on their own and repeated johannes hevelius view that the bright spots are massive and flattened due to their rotation  in  thomas wright speculated correctly that the milky way is a flattened disk of stars and that some of the nebulae visible in the night sky might be separate milky ways   isaac roberts andromeda galaxy toward the end of the century charles messier compiled a catalog containing the brightest celestial objects having nebulous appearance subsequently william herschel assembled a catalog of  nebulae  in  lord rosse constructed a new telescope and was able to distinguish between elliptical and spiral nebulae he also managed to make out individual point sources in some of these nebulae lending credence to kant earlier conjecture  in  vesto slipher made spectrographic studies of the brightest spiral nebulae to determine their composition slipher discovered that the spiral nebulae have high doppler shifts  indicating that they are moving at a rate exceeding the velocity of the stars he had measured he found that the majority of these nebulae are moving away from us   in  heber curtis observed nova s andromedae within the great andromeda nebula as the andromeda galaxy messier object  was then known ing the photographic record he found more novae  curtis noticed that these novae were on average magnitudes fainter than those that occurred within our galaxy as a result he was able to come up with a distance estimate of  parsecs  he became a proponent of the so-called island universes hypothesis which holds that spiral nebulae are actually independent galaxies  in a debate took place between harlow shapley and heber curtis the great debate  concerning the nature of the milky way spiral nebulae and the dimensions of the universe to support his claim that the great andromeda nebula is an external galaxy curtis noted the appearance of dark lanes resembling the dust clouds in the milky way as well as the significant doppler shift  in  the estonian astronomer ernst pik gave a distance determination that supported the theory that the andromeda nebula is indeed a distant extra-galactic object  using the new mt wilson telescope edwin hubble was able to resolve the outer parts of some spiral nebulae as collections of individual stars and identified some cepheid variables  thus allowing him to estimate the distance to the nebulae they were far too distant to be part of the milky way  in hubble produced a classification of galactic morphology that is used to this day  rotation curve galactic core in  hendrik van de hulst predicted that microwave radiation with wavelength of cm would be detectable from interstellar atomic hydrogen gas  and in it was observed this radiation is not affected by dust absorption and so its doppler shift can be used to map the motion of the gas in our galaxy these observations led to the hypothesis of a rotating bar structure in the center of our galaxy  with improved radio telescopes  hydrogen gas could also be traced in other galaxies
in the  vera rubin uncovered a discrepancy between observed galactic rotation speed and that predicted by the visible mass of stars and gas today the galaxy rotation problem is thought to be explained by the presence of large quantities of unseen dark matter    goods  beginning in the  the hubble space telescope yielded improved observations among other things hubble data helped establish that the missing dark matter in our galaxy cannot solely consist of inherently faint and small stars  the hubble deep field  an extremely long exposure of a relatively empty part of the sky provided evidence that there are about billion   galaxies in the observable universe  improved technology in detecting the spectra invisible to humans radio telescopes infrared cameras and x-ray telescopes  allow detection of other galaxies which are not detected by hubble particularly galaxy surveys in the zone of avoidance the region of the sky blocked at visible-light wavelengths by the milky way have revealed a number of new galaxies  a study published in the astrophysical journal and led by christopher conselice of the university of nottingham used years of hubble images to estimate that the observable universe contains at least two trillion   galaxies   however later observations with the new horizons space probe from outside the zodiacal light reduced this to roughly billion     galaxy morphological classification note  galaxies come in three main types ellipticals spirals and irregulars a slightly more extensive description of galaxy types based on their appearance is given by the hubble sequence  since the hubble sequence is entirely based upon visual morphological type shape it may miss certain important characteristics of galaxies such as star formation rate in starburst galaxies and activity in the cores of active galaxies   elliptical galaxy the hubble classification system rates elliptical galaxies on the basis of their ellipticity ranging from  being nearly spherical up to  which is highly elongated these galaxies have an ellipsoidal profile giving them an elliptical appearance regardless of the viewing angle their appearance shows little structure and they typically have relatively little interstellar matter  consequently these galaxies also have a low portion of open clusters and a reduced rate of new star formation instead they are dominated by generally older more evolved stars that are orbiting the common center of gravity in random directions the stars contain low abundances of heavy elements because star formation ceases after the initial burst in this sense they have some similarity to the much smaller globular clusters   the largest galaxies are giant ellipticals many elliptical galaxies are believed to form due to the interaction of galaxies  resulting in a collision and merger they can grow to enormous sizes compared to spiral galaxies for example and giant elliptical galaxies are often found near the core of large galaxy clusters  ngc a shell galaxy is a type of elliptical galaxy where the stars in the galaxy halo are arranged in concentric shells about one-tenth of elliptical galaxies have a shell-like structure which has never been observed in spiral galaxies the shell-like structures are thought to develop when a larger galaxy absorbs a smaller companion galaxy as the two galaxy centers approach the centers start to oscillate around a center point the oscillation creates gravitational ripples forming the shells of stars similar to ripples spreading on water for example galaxy ngc has over twenty shells  spiral galaxy barred spiral galaxy pinwheel galaxy spiral galaxies resemble spiraling pinwheels  though the stars and other visible material contained in such a galaxy lie mostly on a plane the majority of mass in spiral galaxies exists in a roughly spherical halo of dark matter which extends beyond the visible component as demonstrated by the universal rotation curve concept  spiral galaxies consist of a rotating disk of stars and interstellar medium along with a central bulge of generally older stars extending outward from the bulge are relatively bright arms in the hubble classification scheme spiral galaxies are listed as type  followed by a letter    or  which indicates the degree of tightness of the spiral arms and the size of the central bulge an galaxy has tightly wound poorly defined arms and possesses a relatively large core region at the other extreme an galaxy has open well-defined arms and a small core region  a galaxy with poorly defined arms is sometimes referred to as a flocculent spiral galaxy  in contrast to the grand design spiral galaxy that has prominent and well-defined spiral arms  the speed in which a galaxy rotates is thought to correlate with the flatness of the disc as some spiral galaxies have thick bulges while others are thin and dense  ngc barred spiral galaxy in spiral galaxies the spiral arms do have the shape of approximate logarithmic spirals  a pattern that can be theoretically shown to result from a disturbance in a uniformly rotating mass of stars like the stars the spiral arms rotate around the center but they do so with constant angular velocity  the spiral arms are thought to be areas of high-density matter or  density waves   as stars move through an arm the space velocity of each stellar system is modified by the gravitational force of the higher density the velocity returns to normal after the stars depart on the other side of the arm this effect is akin to a wave of slowdowns moving along a highway full of moving cars the arms are visible because the high density facilitates star formation and therefore they harbor many bright and young stars  hoag object ring galaxy a majority of spiral galaxies including our own milky way galaxy have a linear bar-shaped band of stars that extends outward to either side of the core then merges into the spiral arm structure  in the hubble classification scheme these are designated by an  followed by a lower-case letter   or  which indicates the form of the spiral arms in the same manner as the categorization of normal spiral galaxies bars are thought to be temporary structures that can occur as a result of a density wave radiating outward from the core or else due to a tidal interaction with another galaxy  many barred spiral galaxies are active possibly as a result of gas being channeled into the core along the arms  our own galaxy the milky way  is a large disk-shaped barred-spiral galaxy  about in diameter and a kiloparsec thick it contains about two hundred billion    stars and has a total mass of about six hundred billion   times the mass of the sun  recently reers described galaxies called super-luminous spirals they are very large with an upward diameter of  light-years compared to the milky way  light-year diameter with a mass of billion solar masses they generate a significant amount of ultraviolet and mid-infrared light they are thought to have an increased star formation rate around times faster than the milky way   peculiar galaxies ring galaxy  andromeda galaxy infrared  lenticular galaxy  barred lenticular galaxies irregular galaxies  magellanic clouds ultra diffuse galaxy dwarf galaxy despite the prominence of large elliptical and spiral galaxies most galaxies are dwarf galaxies these galaxies are relatively small when compared with other galactic formations being about one hundredth the size of the milky way containing only a few billion stars ultra-compact dwarf galaxies have recently been discovered that are only across  many dwarf galaxies may orbit a single larger galaxy the milky way has at least a dozen such satellites with an estimated yet to be discovered  dwarf galaxies may also be classified as elliptical  spiral  or irregular  since small dwarf ellipticals bear little resemblance to large ellipticals they are often called dwarf spheroidal galaxies instead a study of milky way neighbors found that in all dwarf galaxies the central mass is approximately million solar masses  regardless of whether the galaxy has thousands or millions of stars this has led to the suggestion that galaxies are largely formed by dark matter  and that the minimum size may indicate a form of warm dark matter incapable of gravitational coalescence on a smaller scale  interacting galaxy antennae galaxies interactions between galaxies are relatively frequent and they can play an important role in galactic evolution  near misses between galaxies result in warping distortions due to tidal interactions  and may cause some exchange of gas and dust   collisions occur when two galaxies pass directly through each other and have sufficient relative momentum not to merge the stars of interacting galaxies will usually not collide but the gas and dust within the two forms will interact sometimes triggering star formation a collision can severely distort the shape of the galaxies forming bars rings or tail-like structures   at the extreme of interactions are galactic mergers in this case the relative momentum of the two galaxies is insufficient to allow the galaxies to pass through each other instead they gradually merge to form a single larger galaxy mergers can result in significant changes to morphology as compared to the original galaxies if one of the merging galaxies is much more massive than the other merging galaxy then the result is known as cannibalism  the more massive larger galaxy will remain relatively undisturbed by the merger while the smaller galaxy is torn apart the milky way galaxy is currently in the process of cannibalizing the sagittarius dwarf elliptical galaxy and the canis major dwarf galaxy    starburst galaxy  stars are created within galaxies from a reserve of cold gas that forms into giant molecular clouds  some galaxies have been observed to form stars at an exceptional rate which is known as a starburst if they continue to do so then they would consume their reserve of gas in a time span less than the lifespan of the galaxy hence starburst activity usually lasts only about ten million years a relatively brief period in the history of a galaxy starburst galaxies were more common during the early history of the universe  and at present still contribute an estimated  to the total star production rate  starburst galaxies are characterized by dusty concentrations of gas and the appearance of newly formed stars including massive stars that ionize the surrounding clouds to create h ii regions   these massive stars produce supernova explosions resulting in expanding remnants that interact powerfully with the surrounding gas these outbursts trigger a chain reaction of star building that spreads throughout the gaseous region only when the available gas is nearly consumed or dispersed does the starburst activity end  starbursts are often associated with merging or interacting galaxies the prototype example of such a starburst-forming interaction is  which experienced a close encounter with the larger  irregular galaxies often exhibit spaced knots of starburst activity  active galactic nucleus a portion of the observable galaxies are classified as active galaxies if the galaxy contains an active galactic nucleus agn a significant portion of the total energy output from the galaxy is emitted by the active galactic nucleus instead of the stars dust and interstellar medium of the galaxy there are multiple classification and naming schemes for agns but ones in the lower ranges of luminosity are called seyfert galaxies  while those with luminosities much greater than that of the host galaxy are known as quasi-stellar objects or quasars  agns emit radiation throughout the electromagnetic spectrum from radio wavelengths to x-rays though some of the radiation may be absorbed by dust or gas associated with the agn itself or with the host galaxy the standard model for an active galactic nucleus is based upon an accretion disc that forms around a supermassive black hole smbh at the core region of the galaxy the radiation from an active galactic nucleus results from the gravitational energy of matter as it falls toward the black hole from the disc  the luminosity of an agn depends on the mass of the smbh and the rate at which matter falls onto it
in about  of these galaxies a diametrically opposed pair of energetic jets ejects particles from the galaxy core at velocities close to the speed of light  the mechanism for producing these jets is not well understood  blazar blazars are believed to be an active galaxy with a relativistic jet that is pointed in the direction of earth a radio galaxy emits radio frequencies from relativistic jets a unified model of these types of active galaxies explains their differences based on the viewing angle of the observer  low-ionization nuclear emission-line region possibly related to active galactic nuclei as well as starburst regions are low-ionization nuclear emission-line regions liners the emission from liner-type galaxies is dominated by weakly ionized elements the excitation sources for the weakly ionized lines include post- agb stars agn and shocks  approximately one-third of nearby galaxies are classified as containing liner nuclei    seyfert galaxy seyfert galaxies are one of the two largest groups of active galaxies along with quasars they have quasar-like nuclei very luminous distant and bright sources of electromagnetic radiation with very high surface brightnesses but unlike quasars their host galaxies are clearly detectable seyfert galaxies account for about  of all galaxies seen in visible light most seyfert galaxies look like normal spiral galaxies but when studied under other wavelengths the luminosity of their cores is equivalent to the luminosity of whole galaxies the size of the milky way quasar quasars kwezr or quasi-stellar radio sources are the most energetic and distant members of active galactic nuclei quasars are extremely luminous and were first identified as being high redshift sources of electromagnetic energy including radio waves and visible light that appeared to be similar to stars rather than extended sources similar to galaxies their luminosity can be times that of the milky way luminous infrared galaxy luminous infrared galaxies or lirgs are galaxies with luminosities the measurement of electromagnetic power output above l solar luminosities in most cases most of the energy comes from large numbers of young stars which heat surrounding dust which then reradiates the energy in the infrared luminosity high enough to be a lirg requires a star formation rate of at least  ultra-luminous infrared galaxies ulirgs are at least ten times more luminous still and form stars at rates   many lirgs also emit radiation from an agn infrared galaxies emit more energy in the infrared than at all other wavelengths combined with peak emission typically at wavelengths of to microns lirgs are uncommon in the local universe but were much more common when the universe was younger galaxies have magnetic fields of their own  they are strong enough to be dynamically important they drive mass inflow into the centers of galaxies they modify the formation of spiral arms and they can affect the rotation of gas in the outer regions of galaxies magnetic fields provide the transport of angular momentum required for the collapse of gas clouds and hence the formation of new stars the typical average equipartition strength for spiral galaxies is about g  microgauss  or nt  nanotesla  for comparison the earth magnetic field has an average strength of about  g gauss or t  microtesla  radio-faint galaxies like m and  our milky way neighbors have weaker fields about g while gas-rich galaxies with high star-formation rates like m  m and ngc  have g on average in prominent spiral arms the field strength can be up to g in regions where cold gas and dust are also concentrated the strongest total equipartition fields  g were found in starburst galaxies  for example in m and the antennae  and in nuclear starburst regions for example in the centers of ngc and of other barred galaxies   galaxy formation and evolution galactic formation and evolution is an active area of re in astrophysics   current cosmological models of the early universe are based on the big bang theory about  years after this event atoms of hydrogen and helium began to form in an event called recombination  nearly all the hydrogen was neutral non-ionized and readily absorbed light and no stars had yet formed as a result this period has been called the  dark ages  it was from density fluctuations or anisotropic irregularities in this primordial matter that larger structures began to appear as a result masses of baryonic matter started to condense within cold dark matter halos   these primordial structures would eventually become the galaxies we see today evidence for the appearance of galaxies very early in the universe history was found in  when it was discovered that the galaxy iok- has an unusually high redshift of  corresponding to just million years after the big bang and making it the most distant and earliest-to-form galaxy seen at that time  while some scientists have claimed other objects such as abell  have higher redshifts and therefore are seen in an earlier stage of the universe evolution iok- age and composition have been more reliably established in december  astronomers reported that udfj- is the most distant object known and has a redshift value of  the object estimated to have existed around million years  after the big bang which was about  billion years ago  is about  billion light travel distance years away the existence of galaxies so soon after the big bang suggests that protogalaxies must have grown in the so-called dark ages  as of may   the galaxy egs-- is the most distant and earliest galaxy measured forming million years after the big bang  the light from egs-- has taken billion years to reach earth and is now billion light-years away because of the expansion of the universe during billion years      hubble space telescope  the detailed process by which the earliest galaxies formed is an open question in astrophysics theories can be divided into two categories top-down and bottom-up in top-down correlations such as the eggenlynden-bellsandage els model protogalaxies form in a large-scale simultaneous collapse lasting about one hundred million years  in bottom-up theories such as the searle-zinn sz model small structures such as globular clusters form first and then a number of such bodies accrete to form a larger galaxy  once protogalaxies began to form and contract the first halo stars called population iii stars  appeared within them these were composed almost entirely of hydrogen and helium and may have been more massive than times the sun mass if so these huge stars would have quickly consumed their supply of fuel and became supernovae  releasing heavy elements into the interstellar medium   this first generation of stars re-ionized the surrounding neutral hydrogen creating expanding bubbles of space through which light could readily travel  in june  astronomers reported evidence for population iii stars in the cosmos redshift galaxy at  such stars are likely to have existed in the very early universe ie at high redshift and may have started the production of chemical elements heavier than hydrogen that are needed for the later formation of planets and life as we know it   within a billion years of a galaxy formation key structures begin to appear globular clusters  the central supermassive black hole and a galactic bulge of metal-poor population ii stars form the creation of a supermassive black hole appears to play a key role in actively regulating the growth of galaxies by limiting the total amount of additional matter added  during this early epoch galaxies undergo a major burst of star formation  during the following two billion years the accumulated matter settles into a galactic disc   a galaxy will continue to absorb infalling material from high-velocity clouds and dwarf galaxies throughout its life  this matter is mostly hydrogen and helium the cycle of stellar birth and death slowly increases the abundance of heavy elements eventually allowing the formation of planets   hubble extreme deep field xdf xdf angular size moon stars xdf  observable universe xdf protogalaxies young stars the evolution of galaxies can be significantly affected by interactions and collisions mergers of galaxies were common during the early epoch and the majority of galaxies were peculiar in morphology  given the distances between the stars the great majority of stellar systems in colliding galaxies will be unaffected however gravitational stripping of the interstellar gas and dust that makes up the spiral arms produces a long train of stars known as tidal tails examples of these formations can be seen in ngc  or the antennae galaxies   the milky way galaxy and the nearby andromeda galaxy are moving toward each other at about kms  anddepending upon the lateral movementsthe two might collide in about five to six billion years although the milky way has never collided with a galaxy as large as andromeda before evidence of past collisions of the milky way with smaller dwarf galaxies is increasing  such large-scale interactions are rare as time passes mergers of two systems of equal size become less common most bright galaxies have remained fundamentally unchanged for the last few billion years and the net rate of star formation probably also peaked about ten billion years ago  future of an expanding universe spiral galaxies like the milky way produce new generations of stars as long as they have dense molecular clouds of interstellar hydrogen in their spiral arms  elliptical galaxies are largely devoid of this gas and so form few new stars  the supply of star-forming material is finite once stars have converted the available supply of hydrogen into heavier elements new star formation will come to an end   the current era of star formation is expected to continue for up to one hundred billion years and then the stellar age will wind down after about ten trillion to one hundred trillion years  years as the smallest longest-lived stars in our universe tiny red dwarfs  begin to fade at the end of the stellar age galaxies will be composed of compact objects  brown dwarfs  white dwarfs that are cooling or cold  black dwarfs  neutron stars  and black holes  eventually as a result of gravitational relaxation  all stars will either fall into central supermassive black holes or be flung into intergalactic space as a result of collisions   observable universe large-scale structure galaxy filament galaxy groups and clusters seyfert sextet deep sky surveys show that galaxies are often found in groups and clusters  solitary galaxies that have not significantly interacted with another galaxy of comparable mass during the past billion years are relatively scarce only about five percent of the galaxies surveyed have been found to be truly isolated however these isolated formations may have interacted and even merged with other galaxies in the past and may still be orbited by smaller satellite galaxies isolated galaxies note  can produce stars at a higher rate than normal as their gas is not being stripped by other nearby galaxies  on the largest scale the universe is continually expanding resulting in an average increase in the separation between individual galaxies see hubble law  associations of galaxies can overcome this expansion on a local scale through their mutual gravitational attraction these associations formed early as clumps of dark matter pulled their respective galaxies together nearby groups later merged to form larger-scale clusters this on-going merger process as well as an influx of infalling gas heats the inter-galactic gas within a cluster to very high temperatures reaching megakelvins   about  of the mass in a cluster is in the form of dark matter with  consisting of this heated gas and the remaining few percent of the matter in the form of galaxies  most galaxies are gravitationally bound to a number of other galaxies these form a fractal -like hierarchical distribution of clustered structures with the smallest such associations being termed groups a group of galaxies is the most common type of galactic cluster and these formations contain a majority of the galaxies as well as most of the baryonic mass in the universe   to remain gravitationally bound to such a group each member galaxy must have a sufficiently low velocity to prevent it from escaping see virial theorem  if there is insufficient kinetic energy  however the group may evolve into a smaller number of galaxies through mergers  the largest structures in the universe are larger than expected are these actual structures or random density fluctuations more unsolved problems in physics clusters of galaxies consist of hundreds to thousands of galaxies bound together by gravity  clusters of galaxies are often dominated by a single giant elliptical galaxy known as the brightest cluster galaxy  which over time tidally destroys its satellite galaxies and adds their mass to its own  superclusters contain tens of thousands of galaxies which are found in clusters groups and sometimes individually at the supercluster scale  galaxies are arranged into sheets and filaments surrounding vast empty voids  above this scale the universe appears to be the same in all directions  isotropic and homogeneous   though this notion has been challenged in recent years by numerous findings of large-scale structures that appear to be exceeding this scale the hercules-corona borealis great wall  currently the largest structure in the universe found so far is billion light-years three gigaparsecs in length    the milky way galaxy is a member of an association named the local group  a relatively small group of galaxies that has a diameter of approximately onemegaparsec the milky way and the andromeda galaxy are the two brightest galaxies within the group many of the other member galaxies are dwarf companions of these two  the local group itself is a part of a cloud-like structure within the virgo supercluster  a large extended structure of groups and clusters of galaxies centered on the virgo cluster   and the virgo supercluster itself is a part of the pisces-cetus supercluster complex  a giant galaxy filament  hubble legacy field   observational astronomy andromeda the peak radiation of most stars lies in the visible spectrum  so the observation of the stars that form galaxies has been a major component of optical astronomy  it is also a favorable portion of the spectrum for observing ionized h ii regions  and for examining the distribution of dusty arms the dust present in the interstellar medium is opaque to visual light it is more transparent to far-infrared  which can be used to observe the interior regions of giant molecular clouds and galactic cores in great detail  infrared is also used to observe distant red-shifted galaxies that were formed much earlier water vapor and carbon dioxide absorb a number of useful portions of the infrared spectrum so high-altitude or space-based telescopes are used for infrared astronomy  the first non-visual study of galaxies particularly active galaxies was made using radio frequencies  the earth atmosphere is nearly transparent to radio between mhz and  the ionosphere blocks signals below this range  large radio interferometers have been used to map the active jets emitted from active nuclei radio telescopes can also be used to observe neutral hydrogen via radiation  including potentially the non-ionized matter in the early universe that later collapsed to form galaxies  ultraviolet and x-ray telescopes can observe highly energetic galactic phenomena ultraviolet flares are sometimes observed when a star in a distant galaxy is torn apart from the tidal forces of a nearby black hole  the distribution of hot gas in galactic clusters can be mapped by x-rays the existence of supermassive black holes

galaxy appearance from earth  a hazy band of light seen in the night sky formed from stars that cannot be individually distinguished by the naked eye  the term is a translation of the latin  from the greek   milky circle    from earth the milky way appears as a band because its disk-shaped structure is viewed from within galileo galilei first resolved the band of light into individual stars with his telescope in  until the early  most astronomers thought that the milky way contained all the stars in the universe   following the great debate between the astronomers harlow shapley and heber curtis   observations by edwin hubble showed that the milky way is just one of many galaxies the milky way is a barred spiral galaxy with an estimated visible diameter of  light-years  recent simulations suggest that a dark matter disk also containing some visible stars may extend up to a diameter of almost million light-years   the milky way has several satellite galaxies and is part of the local group of galaxies which form part of the virgo supercluster  which is itself a component of the laniakea supercluster    it is estimated to contain billion stars   and at least that number of planets    the solar system is located at a radius of about  light-years from the galactic center   on the inner edge of the orion arm  one of the spiral-shaped concentrations of gas and dust the stars in the innermost  light-years form a bulge and one or more bars that radiate from the bulge the galactic center is an intense radio source known as sagittarius a  a supermassive black hole of    million solar masses  stars and gases at a wide range of distances from the galactic center orbit at approximately kilometers per second the constant rotation speed contradicts the laws of keplerian dynamics and suggests that much about    of the mass of the milky way is invisible to telescopes neither emitting nor absorbing electromagnetic radiation  this conjectural mass has been termed  dark matter   the rotational period is about million years at the radius of the sun  the milky way as a whole is moving at a velocity of approximately per second with respect to extragalactic frames of reference the oldest stars in the milky way are nearly as old as the universe itself and thus probably formed shortly after the dark ages of the big bang   contents edit sagittarius galactic center light pollution black rock desert antares time-lapse alma the milky way is visible from earth as a hazy band of white light some wide arching the night sky   in night sky observing although all the individual naked-eye stars in the entire sky are part of the milky way galaxy the term milky way is limited to this band of light   the light originates from the accumulation of unresolved stars and other material located in the direction of the galactic plane  brighter regions around the band appear as soft visual patches known as star clouds  the most conspicuous of these is the large sagittarius star cloud  a portion of the central bulge of the galaxy  dark regions within the band such as the great rift and the coalsack  are areas where interstellar dust blocks light from distant stars the area of sky that the milky way obscures is called the zone of avoidance  the milky way has a relatively low surface brightness  its visibility can be greatly reduced by background light such as light pollution or moonlight  the sky needs to be darker than about  magnitude per square arcsecond in order for the milky way to be visible  it should be visible if the limiting magnitude is approximately  or better and shows a great deal of detail at   this makes the milky way difficult to see from brightly lit urban or suburban areas but very prominent when viewed from rural areas when the moon is below the horizon b maps of artificial night sky brightness show that more than one-third of earth population cannot see the milky way from their homes due to light pollution  as viewed from earth the visible region of the milky way galactic plane occupies an area of the sky that includes constellations   the galactic center lies in the direction of sagittarius  where the milky way is brightest from sagittarius the hazy band of white light appears to pass around to the galactic anticenter in auriga  the band then continues the rest of the way around the sky back to sagittarius dividing the sky into two roughly equal hemispheres  the galactic plane is inclined by about to the ecliptic the plane of earth orbit  relative to the celestial equator  it passes as far north as the constellation of cassiopeia and as far south as the constellation of crux  indicating the high inclination of earth equatorial plane and the plane of the ecliptic relative to the galactic plane the north galactic pole is situated at right ascension  declination    near comae berenices  and the south galactic pole is near sculptoris  because of this high inclination depending on the time of night and year the milky way arch may appear relatively low or relatively high in the sky for observers from latitudes approximately north to south the milky way passes directly overhead twice a day night sky composited panorama paranal observatory sagittarius magellanic clouds edit ugc hubble the milky way is the second-largest galaxy in the local group after the andromeda galaxy  with its stellar disk approximately  light-years  in diameter and on average approximately   thick   the milky way is approximately billion to  trillion times the mass of the sun    to compare the relative physical scale of the milky way if the solar system out to neptune were the size of a us quarter   the milky way would be approximately the size of the contiguous united states   there is a ring-like filament of stars rippling above and below the relatively flat galactic plane  wrapping around the milky way at a diameter of  light-years   which may be part of the milky way itself  estimates of the mass of the milky way vary depending upon the method and data used the low end of the estimate range is  solar masses   somewhat less than that of the andromeda galaxy     measurements using the very long baseline array in found velocities as large as s  for stars at the outer edge of the milky way  because the orbital velocity depends on the total mass inside the orbital radius this suggests that the milky way is more massive roughly equaling the mass of andromeda galaxy at within   of its center  in  a measurement of the radial velocity of halo stars found that the mass enclosed within kilo parsecs is   according to a study published in  the mass of the entire milky way is estimated to be    but this is only half the mass of the andromeda galaxy  a recent mass estimate for the milky way is    much of the mass of the milky way seems to be dark matter  an unknown and invisible form of matter that interacts gravitationally with ordinary matter a dark matter halo is conjectured to spread out relatively uniformly to a distance beyond one hundred kiloparsecs kpc from the galactic center mathematical models of the milky way suggest that the mass of dark matter is      recent studies indicate a range in mass as large as   and as small as   the total mass of all the stars in the milky way is estimated to be between   and    in addition to the stars there is also interstellar gas comprising  hydrogen and  helium by mass  with two thirds of the hydrogen found in the atomic form and the remaining one-third as molecular hydrogen   the mass of the milky way interstellar gas is equal to between   and   of the total mass of its stars interstellar dust accounts for an additional  of the total mass of the gas  in march  astronomers reported that the mass of the milky way galaxy is  trillion solar masses within a radius of about  light-years  over twice as much as was determined in earlier studies and suggesting that about  of the mass of the galaxy is dark matter    edit eso gaia interstellar gas dust the milky way contains between - stars   and at least that many planets  an exact figure would depend on counting the number of very-low-mass stars which are difficult to detect especially at distances of more than  from the sun as a comparison the neighboring andromeda galaxy contains an estimated one trillion   stars  the milky way may contain ten billion white dwarfs  a billion neutron stars  and a hundred million stellar black holes  c     filling the space between the stars is a disk of gas and dust called the interstellar medium  this disk has at least a comparable extent in radius to the stars  whereas the thickness of the gas layer ranges from hundreds of light-years for the colder gas to thousands of light-years for warmer gas   the disk of stars in the milky way does not have a sharp edge beyond which there are no stars rather the concentration of stars decreases with distance from the center of the milky way for reasons that are not understood beyond a radius of roughly  ly  kpc from the center the number of stars per cubic parsec drops much faster with radius  surrounding the galactic disk is a spherical galactic halo of stars and globular clusters that extends farther outward but is limited in size by the orbits of two milky way satellites the large and small magellanic clouds  whose closest approach to the galactic center is about    at this distance or beyond the orbits of most halo objects would be disrupted by the magellanic clouds hence such objects would probably be ejected from the vicinity of the milky way the integrated absolute visual magnitude of the milky way is estimated to be around    d both gravitational microlensing and planetary transit observations indicate that there may be at least as many planets bound to stars as there are stars in the milky way   and microlensing measurements indicate that there are more rogue planets not bound to host stars than there are stars   the milky way contains at least one planet per star resulting in billion planets according to a january study of the five-planet star system kepler- by the kepler space observatory  a different january analysis of kepler data estimated that at least billion earth-sized exoplanets reside in the milky way  on november   astronomers reported based on space mission data that there could be as many as billion earth-sized planets orbiting in the habitable zones of sun-like stars and red dwarfs within the milky way    billion of these estimated planets may be orbiting sun-like stars  the nearest exoplanet may be  light-years away orbiting the red dwarf proxima centauri  according to a study  such earth-sized planets may be more numerous than gas giants  besides exoplanets  exocomets  comets beyond the solar system have also been detected and may be common in the milky way  more recently in november  over million habitable exoplanets are estimated to exist in the milky way galaxy  edit the milky way consists of a bar-shaped core region surrounded by a warped disk of gas dust and stars   the mass distribution within the milky way closely resembles the type sbc in the hubble classification  which represents spiral galaxies with relatively loosely wound arms  astronomers first began to conjecture that the milky way is a barred spiral galaxy  rather than an ordinary spiral galaxy  in the     these conjectures were confirmed by the spitzer space telescope observations in  that showed the milky way central bar to be larger than previously thought edit galactic quadrant galactic coordinate system a galactic quadrant or quadrant of the milky way refers to one of four circular sectors in the division of the milky way in astronomical practice the delineation of the galactic quadrants is based upon the galactic coordinate system  which places the sun as the origin of the mapping system   quadrants are described using ordinals for example  galactic quadrant  second galactic quadrant  or third quadrant of the milky way  viewing from the north galactic pole with zero degrees as the ray that runs starting from the sun and through the galactic center the quadrants are      with the galactic longitude  increasing in the counter-clockwise direction  positive rotation  as viewed from north of the galactic center a view-point several hundred thousand light-years distant from earth in the direction of the constellation coma berenices  if viewed from south of the galactic center a view-point similarly distant in the constellation sculptor  would increase in the clockwise direction  negative rotation  edit galactic center the sun is   from the galactic center this value is estimated using geometric -based methods or by measuring selected astronomical objects that serve as standard candles  with different techniques yielding various values within this approximate range       in the inner few kiloparsecs around -years radius is a dense concentration of mostly old stars in a roughly spheroidal shape called the bulge   it has been proposed that the milky way lacks a bulge due to a collision and merger between previous galaxies  and that instead it only has a formed by its central bar  however confusion in the literature between the peanut shell-shaped structure created by instabilities in the bar versus a possible bulge with an expected half-light radius of   abounds x-ray sagittarius a supermassive black hole  the galactic center is marked by an intense radio source named sagittarius a pronounced  the motion of material around the center indicates that sagittariusa harbors a massive compact object  this concentration of mass is best explained as a supermassive black hole e   smbh with an estimated mass of  million times the mass of the sun   the rate of accretion of the smbh is consistent with an inactive galactic nucleus  being estimated at around per year  observations indicate that there are smbhs located near the center of most normal galaxies   the nature of the milky way bar is actively debated with estimates for its half-length and orientation spanning from  and relative to the line of sight from earth to the galactic center    certain authors advocate that the milky way features two distinct bars one nestled within the other  however rrlyrae-type stars do not trace a prominent galactic bar    the bar may be surrounded by a ring called the  ring that contains a large fraction of the molecular hydrogen present in the milky way as well as most of the milky way star formation activity viewed from the andromeda galaxy it would be the brightest feature of the milky way  x-ray emission from the core is aligned with the massive stars surrounding the central bar  and the galactic ridge   x-ray gamma-ray in  two gigantic spherical bubbles of high energy emission were detected to the north and the south of the milky way core using data from the fermi gamma-ray space telescope  the diameter of each of the bubbles is about  light-years  they stretch up to grus and to virgo on the night-sky of the southern hemisphere   subsequently observations with the parkes telescope at radio frequencies identified polarized emission that is associated with the fermi bubbles these observations are best interpreted as a magnetized outflow driven by star formation in the central  of the milky way  later on january   nasa reported observing an x-ray flare times brighter than usual a record-breaker from sagittariusa the unusual event may have been caused by the breaking apart of an asteroid falling into the black hole or by the entanglement of magnetic field lines within gas flowing into sagittariusa  edit spiral galaxy outside the gravitational influence of the galactic bar the structure of the interstellar medium and stars in the disk of the milky way is organized into four spiral arms  spiral arms typically contain a higher density of interstellar gas and dust than the galactic average as well as a greater concentration of star formation as traced by h ii regions   and molecular clouds   the milky way spiral structure is uncertain and there is currently no consensus on the nature of the milky way arms  perfect logarithmic spiral patterns only crudely describe features near the sun   because galaxies commonly have arms that branch merge twist unexpectedly and feature a degree of irregularity    the possible scenario of the sun within a spur  local arm  emphasizes that point and indicates that such features are probably not unique and exist elsewhere in the milky way  estimates of the pitch angle of the arms range from about to    there are thought to be four spiral arms that all start near the milky way galaxy center  these are named as follows with the positions of the arms shown in the image below spitzer sgra  near kpc arm perseus arm norma outer arm  scutumcentaurus arm carina-sagittarius arm orioncygnus arm two spiral arms the scutumcentaurus arm and the carinasagittarius arm have tangent points inside the sun orbit about the center of the milky way if these arms contain an overdensity of stars compared to the average density of stars in the galactic disk it would be detectable by counting the stars near the tangent point two surveys of near-infrared light which is sensitive primarily to red giants and not affected by dust extinction detected the predicted overabundance in the scutumcentaurus arm but not in the carinasagittarius arm the scutumcentaurus arm contains approximately  more red giants than would be expected in the absence of a spiral arm   this observation suggests that the milky way possesses only two major stellar arms the perseus arm and the scutumcentaurus arm the rest of the arms contain excess gas but not excess old stars  in december  astronomers found that the distribution of young stars and star-forming regions matches the four-arm spiral description of the milky way    thus the milky way appears to have two spiral arms as traced by old stars and four spiral arms as traced by gas and young stars the explanation for this apparent discrepancy is unclear  wise the near kpc arm also called the or simply the  was discovered in the by astronomer vanwoerden and collaborators through radio measurements of h  atomic hydrogen    it was found to be expanding away from the central bulge at more than kms  it is located in the fourth galactic quadrant at a distance of about  kpc from the sun and  from the galactic center  the far arm was discovered in by astronomer tom dame harvardsmithsonian cfa it is located in the first galactic quadrant at a distance of kpc about  ly  from the galactic center   a simulation published in suggested that the milky way may have obtained its spiral arm structure as a result of repeated collisions with the sagittarius dwarf elliptical galaxy   it has been suggested that the milky way contains two different spiral patterns an inner one formed by the sagittarius arm that rotates fast and an outer one formed by the carina and perseus arms whose rotation velocity is slower and whose arms are tightly wound in this scenario suggested by numerical simulations of the dynamics of the different spiral arms the outer pattern would form an outer pseudoring   and the two patterns would be connected by the cygnus arm  outside of the major spiral arms is the monoceros ring or outer ring a ring of gas and stars torn from other galaxies billions of years ago however several members of the scientific community recently restated their position affirming the monoceros structure is nothing more than an over-density produced by the flared and warped thick disk of the milky way  the structure of the milky way disk is warped along an s curve   edit the galactic disk is surrounded by a spheroidal halo of old stars and globular clusters of which  lie within  light-years  of the galactic center  however a few globular clusters have been found farther such as and at more than -years from the galactic center about  of the milky way clusters are on retrograde orbits  which means they move in the opposite direction from the milky way rotation  the globular clusters can follow rosette orbits about the milky way in contrast to the elliptical orbit of a planet around a star  although the disk contains dust that obscures the view in some wavelengths the halo component does not active star formation takes place in the disk especially in the spiral arms which represent areas of high density but does not take place in the halo as there is little cool gas to collapse into stars  open clusters are also located primarily in the disk  discoveries in the early have added dimension to the knowledge of the milky way structure with the discovery that the disk of the andromeda galaxy  extends much farther than previously thought  the possibility of the disk of the milky way extending farther is apparent and this is supported by evidence from the discovery of the outer arm extension of the cygnus arm   and of a similar extension of the scutumcentaurus arm   with the discovery of the sagittarius dwarf elliptical galaxy came the discovery of a ribbon of galactic debris as the polar orbit of the dwarf and its interaction with the milky way tears it apart similarly with the discovery of the canis major dwarf galaxy  it was found that a ring of galactic debris from its interaction with the milky way encircles the galactic disk the sloan digital sky survey of the northern sky shows a huge and diffuse structure spread out across an area around  the size of a full moon within the milky way that does not seem to fit within current models the collection of stars rises close to perpendicular to the plane of the spiral arms of the milky way the proposed likely interpretation is that a dwarf galaxy is merging with the milky way this galaxy is tentatively named the virgo stellar stream and is found in the direction of virgo about  light-years  away  edit in addition to the stellar halo the chandra x-ray observatory  xmm-newton  and have provided evidence that there is a gaseous halo with a large amount of hot gas the halo extends for hundreds of thousand of light-years much farther than the stellar halo and close to the distance of the large and small magellanic clouds  the mass of this hot halo is nearly equivalent to the mass of the milky way itself    the temperature of this halo gas is between and   and   observations of distant galaxies indicate that the universe had about one-sixth as much baryonic ordinary matter as dark matter when it was just a few billion years old however only about half of those baryons are accounted for in the modern universe based on observations of nearby galaxies like the milky way  if the finding that the mass of the halo is comparable to the mass of the milky way is confirmed it could be the identity of the missing baryons around the milky way  edit the sun is near the inner rim of the orion arm  within the local fluff of the local bubble  and in the gould belt  based upon studies of stellar orbits around sgra by gillessen  the sun lies at an estimated distance of    from the galactic center boehle  found a smaller value of   also using a star orbit analysis  the sun is currently parsecs  above or north of the central plane of the galactic disk  the distance between the local arm and the next arm out the perseus arm  is about  parsecs   the sun and thus the solar system is located in the milky way galactic habitable zone  there are about brighter than absolute magnitude  within a sphere with a radius of parsecs  from the sun giving a density of one star per parsecs or one star per  light-years from list of nearest bright stars  on the other hand there are stars of any magnitude not counting brown dwarfs  within parsecs  of the sun giving a density of about one star per  parsecs or one per light-years from list of nearest stars  this illustrates the fact that there are far more faint stars than bright stars in the entire sky there are about brighter than apparent magnitude but  stars brighter than apparent magnitude   the apex of the sun way or the solar apex  is the direction that the sun travels through space in the milky way the general direction of the sun galactic motion is towards the star vega near the constellation of hercules  at an angle of roughly degrees to the direction of the galactic center the sun orbit about the milky way is expected to be roughly elliptical with the addition of perturbations due to the galactic spiral arms and non-uniform mass distributions in addition the sun passes through the galactic plane approximately  per orbit  this is very similar to how a simple harmonic oscillator works with no drag force damping term these oscillations were until recently thought to coincide with mass lifeform extinction periods on earth  a reanalysis of the effects of the sun transit through the spiral structure based on co data has failed to find a correlation  however the suns transit through the galactic plane is still considered a possible explanation for extinctions and this is called the shiva hypothesis   it takes the solar system about years to complete one orbit of the milky way a galactic year   so the sun is thought to have completed during its lifetime and  of a revolution since the origin of humans  the orbital speed of the solar system about the center of the milky way is approximately s  or  of the speed of light  the sun moves through the heliosphere at h  at this speed it takes around  for the solar system to travel a distance of -year or to travel  astronomical unit   the solar system is headed in the direction of the zodiacal constellation scorpius  which follows the ecliptic  edit galaxy rotation curve    the stars and gas in the milky way rotate about its center differentially  meaning that the rotation period varies with location as is typical for spiral galaxies the orbital speed of most stars in the milky way does not depend strongly on their distance from the center away from the central bulge or outer rim the typical stellar orbital speed is between s   hence the orbital period of the typical star is directly proportional only to the length of the path traveled this is unlike the situation within the solar system where two-body gravitational dynamics dominate and different orbits have significantly different velocities associated with them the rotation curve shown in the figure describes this rotation toward the center of the milky way the orbit speeds are too low whereas beyond kpcs the speeds are too high to match what would be expected from the universal law of gravitation if the milky way contained only the mass observed in stars gas and other baryonic ordinary matter the rotation speed would decrease with distance from the center however the observed curve is relatively flat indicating that there is additional mass that cannot be detected directly with electromagnetic radiation this inconsistency is attributed to dark matter  the rotation curve of the milky way agrees with the universal rotation curve of spiral galaxies the best evidence for the existence of dark matter in galaxies alternatively a minority of astronomers propose that a modification of the law of gravity may explain the observed rotation curve  edit galaxy formation and evolution the milky way began as one or several small overdensities in the mass distribution in the universe shortly after the big bang   some of these overdensities were the seeds of globular clusters in which the oldest remaining stars in what is now the milky way formed nearly half the matter in the milky way may have come from other distant galaxies  nonetheless these stars and clusters now comprise the stellar halo of the milky way within a few billion years of the birth of the first stars the mass of the milky way was large enough so that it was spinning relatively quickly due to conservation of angular momentum  this led the gaseous interstellar medium to collapse from a roughly spheroidal shape to a disk therefore later generations of stars formed in this spiral disk most younger stars including the sun are observed to be in the disk   since the first stars began to form the milky way has grown through both galaxy mergers particularly early in the milky way growth and accretion of gas directly from the galactic halo  the milky way is currently accreting material from several small galaxies including two of its largest satellite galaxies the large and small magellanic clouds through the magellanic stream  direct accretion of gas is observed in high-velocity clouds like the smith cloud    cosmological simulations indicate that billion years ago it merged with a particularly large galaxy that has been labeled the kraken    however properties of the milky way such as stellar mass angular momentum  and metallicity in its outermost regions suggest it has undergone no mergers with large galaxies in the last billion years this lack of recent major mergers is unusual among similar spiral galaxies its neighbour the andromeda galaxy appears to have a more typical history shaped by more recent mergers with relatively large galaxies   according to recent studies the milky way as well as the andromeda galaxy lie in what in the galaxy colormagnitude diagram is known as the green valley a region populated by galaxies in transition from the blue cloud galaxies actively forming new stars to the red sequence galaxies that lack star formation star-formation activity in green valley galaxies is slowing as they run out of star-forming gas in the interstellar medium in simulated galaxies with similar properties star formation will typically have been extinguished within about five billion years from now even accounting for the expected short-term increase in the rate of star formation due to the collision between both the milky way and the andromeda galaxy  in fact measurements of other galaxies similar to the milky way suggest it is among the reddest and brightest spiral galaxies that are still forming new stars and it is just slightly bluer than the bluest red sequence galaxies  edit  globular clusters are among the oldest objects in the milky way which thus set a lower limit on the age of the milky way the ages of individual stars in the milky way can be estimated by measuring the abundance of long-lived radioactive elements such as thorium- and uranium-  then comparing the results to estimates of their original abundance a technique called nucleocosmochronology  these yield values of about for cs -  and for bd    once a white dwarf is formed it begins to undergo radiative cooling and the surface temperature steadily drops by measuring the temperatures of the coolest of these white dwarfs and comparing them to their expected initial temperature an age estimate can be made with this technique the age of the globular cluster was estimated as  age estimates of the oldest of these clusters gives a best fit estimate of  years and a  confidence upper limit of years  in november  astronomers reported the discovery of one of the oldest stars in the universe  about  billion-years-old - b is a tiny ultra metal-poor ump star made almost entirely of materials released from the big bang  and is possibly one of the first stars the discovery of the star in the milky way galaxy suggests that the galaxy may be at least billion years older than previously thought    several individual stars have been found in the milky way halo with measured ages very close to the -billion-year age of the universe  in  a star in the galactic halo he -  was estimated to be about  billion years old as the oldest known object in the milky way at that time this measurement placed a lower limit on the age of the milky way  this estimate was made using the uv-visual echelle spectrograph of the very large telescope to measure the relative strengths of spectral lines caused by the presence of thorium and other elements created by the r-process  the line strengths yield abundances of different elemental isotopes  from which an estimate of the age of the star can be derived using nucleocosmochronology   another star hd  is   billion years old   according to observations utilizing adaptive optics to correct for earth atmospheric distortion stars in the galaxy bulge date to about  billion years old  the age of stars in the galactic thin disk has also been estimated using nucleocosmochronology measurements of thin disk stars yield an estimate that the thin disk formed   billion years ago these measurements suggest there was a hiatus of almost billion years between the formation of the galactic halo and the thin disk  recent analysis of the chemical signatures of thousands of stars suggests that stellar formation might have dropped by an order of magnitude at the time of disk formation to billion years ago when interstellar gas was too hot to form new stars at the same rate as before  the satellite galaxies surrounding the milky way are not randomly distributed but seemed to be the result of a break-up of some larger system producing a ring structure  light-years in diameter and  light-years wide  close encounters between galaxies like that expected in billion years with the andromeda galaxy rips off huge tails of gas which over time can coalesce to form dwarf galaxies in a ring at an arbitrary angle to the main disc  edit local group laniakea supercluster local group the milky way and the andromeda galaxy are a binary system of giant spiral galaxies belonging to a group of closely bound galaxies known as the local group  surrounded by a local void itself being part of the local sheet  and in turn the virgo supercluster  surrounding the virgo supercluster are a number of voids devoid of many galaxies the microscopium void to the north the sculptor void to the left the bootes void to the right and the canes-major void to the south these voids change shape over time creating filamentous structures of galaxies the virgo supercluster for instance is being drawn towards the great attractor   which in turn forms part of a greater structure called laniakea   two smaller galaxies and a number of dwarf galaxies in the local group orbit the milky way the largest of these is the large magellanic cloud with a diameter of  light-years it has a close companion the small magellanic cloud  the magellanic stream is a stream of neutral hydrogen gas extending from these two small galaxies across of the sky the stream is thought to have been dragged from the magellanic clouds in tidal interactions with the milky way  some of the dwarf galaxies orbiting the milky way are canis major dwarf the closest sagittarius dwarf elliptical galaxy  ursa minor dwarf  sculptor dwarf  sextans dwarf  fornax dwarf  and leo i dwarf  the smallest dwarf galaxies of the milky way are only light-years in diameter these include carina dwarf  draco dwarf  and leo ii dwarf  there may still be undetected dwarf galaxies that are dynamically bound to the milky way which is supported by the detection of nine new satellites of the milky way in a relatively small patch of the night sky in   there are also some dwarf galaxies that have already been absorbed by the milky way such as the progenitor of omega centauri   in reers reported that most satellite galaxies of the milky way lie in a very large disk and orbit in the same direction  this came as a surprise according to standard cosmology the satellite galaxies should form in dark matter halos and they should be widely distributed and moving in random directions this discrepancy is still not fully explained  in january  reers reported that the heretofore unexplained warp in the disk of the milky way has now been mapped and found to be a ripple or vibration set up by the large and small magellanic clouds as they orbit the milky way causing vibrations when they pass through its edges previously these two galaxies at around  of the mass of the milky way were considered too small to influence the milky way however in a computer model the movement of these two galaxies creates a dark matter wake that amplifies their influence on the larger milky way  current measurements suggest the andromeda galaxy is approaching us at to s  to  in to billion years there may be an andromedamilky way collision  depending on the importance of unknown lateral components to the galaxies relative motion if they collide the chance of individual stars colliding with each other is extremely low but instead the two galaxies will merge to form a single elliptical galaxy or perhaps a large disk galaxy  over the course of about a billion years  edit although special relativity states that there is no preferred inertial frame of reference in space with which to compare the milky way the milky way does have a velocity with respect to cosmological frames of reference  one such frame of reference is the hubble flow  the apparent motions of galaxy clusters due to the expansion of space  individual galaxies including the milky way have peculiar velocities relative to the average flow thus to compare the milky way to the hubble flow one must consider a volume large enough so that the expansion of the universe dominates over local random motions a large enough volume means that the mean motion of galaxies within this volume is equal to the hubble flow astronomers believe the milky way is moving at approximately s  with respect to this local co-moving frame of reference  the milky way is moving in the general direction of the great attractor and other galaxy clusters  including the shapley supercluster  behind it  the local group a cluster of gravitationally bound galaxies containing among others the milky way and the andromeda galaxy is part of a supercluster called the local supercluster  centered near the virgo cluster  although they are moving away from each other at s  as part of the hubble flow this velocity is less than would be expected given the  pc distance due to the gravitational attraction between the local group and the virgo cluster  another reference frame is provided by the cosmic microwave background cmb the milky way is moving at  with respect to the photons of the cmb toward  right ascension declination  epoch near the center of hydra  this motion is observed by satellites such as the cosmic background explorer cobe and the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe wmap as a dipole contribution to the cmb as photons in equilibrium in the cmb frame get blue-shifted in the direction of the motion and red-shifted in the opposite direction  edit the origin of the milky way tintoretto list of names for the milky way milky way mythology in the babylonian epic poem enma eli  the milky way is created from the severed tail of the primeval salt water dragoness tiamat  set in the sky by marduk  the babylonian national god  after slaying her   this story was once thought to have been based on an older sumerian version in which tiamat is instead slain by enlil of nippur    but is now thought to be purely an invention of babylonian propagandists with the intention to show marduk as superior to the sumerian deities  llys dn literally the court of dn  is the traditional welsh name for the constellation cassiopeia  at least three of dn children also have astronomical associations caer gwydion the fortress of gwydion  is the traditional welsh name for the milky way   and caer arianrhod the fortress of arianrhod  being the constellation of corona borealis  in western culture the name milky way is derived from its appearance as a dim un-resolved milky glowing band arching across the night sky the term is a translation of the classical latin  in turn derived from the hellenistic greek  short for   milky circle the ancient greek   from root - milk  forming adjectives is also the root of galaxy the name for our and later all such collections of stars     in greek mythology  the milky way was formed after the trickster god hermes suckled the infant heracles at the breast of hera  the queen of the gods while she was asleep   when hera awoke she tore heracles away from her breast and splattered her breast milk across the heavens   in another version of the story athena  the patron goddess of heroes tricked hera into suckling heracles voluntarily   but he bit her nipple so hard that she flung him away spraying milk everywhere   the milky way or milk circle was just one of circles the greeks identified in the sky others being the zodiac  the meridian  the horizon  the equator  the tropics of cancer and capricorn  arctic and antarctic circles  and two colure circles passing through both poles  edit galaxy observation history william herschel in meteorologica  aristotle  bc states that the greek philosophers anaxagoras  bc and democritus  bc proposed that the milky way is the glow of stars not directly visible due to earth shadow while other stars receive their light from the sun but have their glow obscured by solar rays  aristotle himself believed that the milky way was part of the earth upper atmosphere along with the stars and that it was a byproduct of stars burning that did not dissipate because of its outermost location in the atmosphere composing its great circle    the neoplatonist philosopher olympiodorus the younger   criticized this view arguing that if the milky way were sublunary  it should appear different at different times and places on earth and that it should have parallax  which it does not in his view the milky way is celestial this idea would be influential later in the islamic world   the persian astronomer ab rayhn al-brn  proposed that the milky way is a collection of countless fragments of the nature of nebulous stars  the andalusian astronomer avempace   proposed the milky way to be made up of many stars but appears to be a continuous image due to the effect of refraction in earth atmosphere citing his observation of a conjunction of jupiter and mars in or as evidence  according to jamil ragep the persian astronomer nar al-dn al-s  in his writes the milky way ie the galaxy is made up of a very large number of small tightly clustered stars which on account of their concentration and smallness seem to be cloudy patches because of this it was likened to milk in color  ibn qayyim al-jawziyya  proposed that the milky way is a myriad of tiny stars packed together in the sphere of the fixed stars and that these stars are larger than planets  proof of the milky way consisting of many stars came in when galileo galilei used a telescope to study the milky way and discovered that it is composed of a huge number of faint stars   in a treatise in  immanuel kant  drawing on earlier work by thomas wright   speculated correctly that the milky way might be a rotating body of a huge number of stars held together by gravitational forces akin to the solar system but on much larger scales  the resulting disk of stars would be seen as a band on the sky from our perspective inside the disk wright and kant also conjectured that some of the nebulae visible in the night sky might be separate galaxies themselves similar to our own kant referred to both the milky way and the extragalactic nebulae as island universes a term still current up to the     the first attempt to describe the shape of the milky way and the position of the sun within it was carried out by william herschel in by carefully counting the number of stars in different regions of the visible sky he produced a diagram of the shape of the milky way with the solar system close to the center  in  lord rosse constructed a new telescope and was able to distinguish between elliptical and spiral-shaped nebulae he also managed to make out individual point sources in some of these nebulae lending credence to kant earlier conjecture   andromeda galaxy in  studying the proper motions of stars jacobus kapteyn reported that these were not random as it was believed in that time stars could be divided into two streams moving in nearly opposite directions  it was later realized that kapteyn data had been the first evidence of the rotation of our galaxy  which ultimately led to the finding of galactic rotation by bertil lindblad and jan oort  in  heber curtis had observed the nova s andromedae within the great andromeda nebula  messier object  ing the photographic record he found more novae  curtis noticed that these novae were on average magnitudes fainter than those that occurred within the milky way as a result he was able to come up with a distance estimate of  parsecs he became a proponent of the island universes hypothesis which held that the spiral nebulae were independent galaxies   in the great debate took place between harlow shapley and heber curtis concerning the nature of the milky way spiral nebulae and the dimensions of the universe to support his claim that the great andromeda nebula is an external galaxy curtis noted the appearance of dark lanes resembling the dust clouds in the milky way as well as the significant doppler shift   the controversy was conclusively settled by edwin hubble in the early using the mount wilson observatory   hooker telescope  with the light-gathering power of this new telescope he was able to produce astronomical photographs that resolved the outer parts of some spiral nebulae as collections of individual stars he was also able to identify some cepheid variables that he could use as a benchmark to estimate the distance to the nebulae he found that the andromeda nebula is  parsecs from the sun far too distant to be part of the milky way   edit the esa spacecraft gaia provides distance estimates by determining the parallax of a billion stars and is mapping the milky way with four planned releases of maps in   and    a study in concluded that detected a wobbling motion of the galaxy which might be caused by  torques from a misalignment of the disc rotation axis with respect to the principle axis of a non-spherical halo or from accreted matter in the halo acquired during late infall or from nearby interacting satellite galaxies and

statement natural satellite  to   to  moon moons disambiguation irregular moons ganymede titan callisto io moon list of natural satellites list a natural satellite  or moon  is in the most common usage an astronomical body that orbits a planet or minor planet or sometimes another small solar system body  in the solar system  there are six planetary satellite systems containing known natural satellites iau -listed dwarf planets are also known to have natural satellites pluto  haumea  makemake  and eris   as of update  there are other minor planets known to have moons   a planet usually has at least around times the mass of any natural satellites that orbit it with a correspondingly much larger diameter  the earthmoon system is the unique exception in the solar system at   miles across the moon is  times the diameter of earth  the next largest ratios are neptune at  saturn at  jupiter at  and uranus at  for the category of planetoids  among the five that are known in the solar system charon has the largest ratio being  the diameter of pluto  contents edit the first known natural satellite was the moon  but it was considered a planet until copernicus  introduction of de revolutionibus orbium coelestium in  until the discovery of the galilean satellites in there was no opportunity for referring to such objects as a class galileo chose to refer to his discoveries as planets but later discoverers chose other terms to distinguish them from the objects they orbited the first to use the term to describe orbiting bodies was the german astronomer johannes kepler in his pamphlet narration about four satellites of jupiter observed in  he derived the term from the latin word  meaning guard attendant or companion because the accompanied their primary planet in their journey through the heavens  the term thus became the normal one for referring to an object orbiting a planet as it avoided the ambiguity of moon in  however the launching of the artificial object sputnik created a need for new terminology   the terms and were very quickly abandoned in favor of the simpler  and as a consequence the term has become linked primarily with artificial objects flown in space including sometimes even those not in orbit around a planet because of this shift in meaning the term  which had continued to be used in a generic sense in works of popular science and in fiction has regained respectability and is now used interchangeably with  even in scientific articles when it is necessary to avoid both the ambiguity of confusion with earth natural satellite the moon and the natural satellites of the other planets on the one hand and artificial satellites on the other the term using natural in a sense opposed to artificial is used to further avoid ambiguity the convention is to capitalize the word moon when referring to earth natural satellite but not when referring to other natural satellites many authors define satellite or natural satellite as orbiting some planet or minor planet synonymous with moon by such a definition all natural satellites are moons but earth and other planets are not satellites    a few recent authors define moon as a satellite of a planet or minor planet and planet as a satellite of a star such authors consider earth as a natural satellite of the sun    edit earth moon there is no established lower limit on what is considered a moon every natural celestial body with an identified orbit around a planet of the solar system  some as small as a kilometer across has been considered a moon though objects a tenth that size within saturn rings which have not been directly observed have been called moonlets  small asteroid moons natural satellites of asteroids such as dactyl  have also been called moonlets  the upper limit is also vague two orbiting bodies are sometimes described as a double planet rather than primary and satellite asteroids such as antiope are considered double asteroids but they have not forced a clear definition of what constitutes a moon some authors consider the plutocharon system to be a double dwarf planet the most common dividing line on what is considered a moon rests upon whether the barycentre is below the surface of the larger body though this is somewhat arbitrary because it depends on distance as well as relative mass edit circumplanetary disk dione occults enceladus the natural satellites orbiting relatively close to the planet on prograde  uninclined circular orbits  satellites  are generally thought to have been formed out of the same collapsing region of the protoplanetary disk that created its primary   in contrast irregular satellites generally orbiting on distant inclined  eccentric andor retrograde orbits are thought to be captured asteroids possibly further fragmented by collisions most of the major natural satellites of the solar system have regular orbits while most of the small natural satellites have irregular orbits  the moon  and possibly charon  are exceptions among large bodies in that they are thought to have originated by the collision of two large proto-planetary objects see the giant impact hypothesis  the material that would have been placed in orbit around the central body is predicted to have reaccreted to form one or more orbiting natural satellites as opposed to planetary-sized bodies asteroid moons are thought to commonly form by this process triton is another exception although large and in a close circular orbit its motion is retrograde and it is thought to be a captured dwarf planet  edit temporary satellite the capture of an asteroid from a heliocentric orbit is not always permanent according to simulations temporary satellites should be a common phenomenon   the only observed examples are vg  rh  cd  rh was a temporary satellite of earth for nine months in and    edit tidal locking most regular moons natural satellites following relatively close and prograde orbits with small orbital inclination and eccentricity in the solar system are tidally locked to their respective primaries meaning that the same side of the natural satellite always faces its planet this phenomenon comes about through a loss of energy due to tidal forces raised by the planet slowing the rotation of the satellite until it is negligible  the only known exception is saturn natural satellite hyperion  which rotates chaotically because of the gravitational influence of titan  in contrast the outer natural satellites of the giant planets irregular satellites are too far away to have become locked for example jupiter himalia  saturn phoebe  and neptune nereid have rotation periods in the range of ten hours whereas their orbital periods are hundreds of days edit subsatellite rhea no moons of moons or subsatellites natural satellites that orbit a natural satellite of a planet are currently known in most cases the tidal effects of the planet would make such a system unstable however calculations performed after the detection  of a possible ring system around saturn moon rhea indicate that satellites orbiting rhea could have stable orbits furthermore the suspected rings are thought to be narrow  a phenomenon normally associated with shepherd moons  however targeted images taken by the cassini spacecraft failed to detect rings around rhea  it has also been proposed that saturn moon iapetus had a satellite in the past this is one of several hypotheses that have been put forward to account for its equatorial ridge   edit two natural satellites are known to have small companions at both their l and l lagrangian points  sixty degrees ahead and behind the body in its orbit these companions are called trojan moons  as their orbits are analogous to the trojan asteroids of jupiter  the trojan moons are telesto and calypso  which are the leading and following companions respectively of the saturnian moon tethys  and helene and polydeuces  the leading and following companions of the saturnian moon dione  edit asteroid moon the discovery of ida natural satellite dactyl in the early confirmed that some asteroids have natural satellites indeed sylvia has two some such as antiope  are double asteroids with two comparably sized components edit satellite planet solar system mimas enceladus miranda neptune moon proteus is the largest irregularly shaped natural satellite all other known natural satellites that are at least the size of uranus miranda have lapsed into rounded ellipsoids under hydrostatic equilibrium  ie are roundrounded satellites the larger natural satellites being tidally locked tend toward ovoid egg-like shapes squat at their poles and with longer equatorial axes in the direction of their primaries their planets than in the direction of their motion saturn moon mimas  for example has a major axis  greater than its polar axis and  greater than its other equatorial axis methone  another of saturn moons is only around in diameter and visibly egg-shaped  the effect is smaller on the largest natural satellites where their own gravity is greater relative to the effects of tidal distortion especially those that orbit less massive planets or as in the case of the moon  at greater distances mimas saturn enceladus miranda uranus tethys io jupiter the moon earth edit does not cite any sources improve this section adding citations to reliable sources removed learn how and when to remove this template message of the nineteen known natural satellites in the solar system that are large enough to have lapsed into hydrostatic equilibrium  several remain geologically active today io is the most volcanically active body in the solar system while europa  enceladus  titan and triton display evidence of ongoing tectonic activity and cryovolcanism  in the first three cases the geological activity is powered by the tidal heating resulting from having eccentric orbits close to their giant-planet primaries this mechanism would have also operated on triton in the past before its orbit was circularized  many other natural satellites such as earth moon  ganymede  tethys and miranda  show evidence of past geological activity resulting from energy sources such as the decay of their primordial radioisotopes  greater past orbital eccentricities due in some cases to past orbital resonances  or the differentiation or freezing of their interiors enceladus and triton both have active features resembling geysers  although in the case of triton solar heating appears to provide the energy titan and triton have significant atmospheres titan also has hydrocarbon lakes  also io and callisto have atmospheres even if they are extremely thin  four of the largest natural satellites europa  ganymede  callisto  and titan  are thought to have subsurface oceans of liquid water while smaller enceladus may have localized subsurface liquid water edit euler diagram of the objects within our solar system known to have natural satellites there are in the asteroid belt five with two each four jupiter trojans  near-earth objects two with two satellites each and mars-crossers   there are also known natural satellites of trans-neptunian objects   some additional small bodies have been observed within the rings of saturn  but only a few were tracked long enough to establish orbits planets around other stars are likely to have satellites as well and although numerous candidates have been detected to date none have yet been confirmed of the inner planets mercury and venus have no natural satellites earth has one large natural satellite known as the moon and mars has two tiny natural satellites phobos and deimos 
the giant planets have extensive systems of natural satellites including half a dozen comparable in size to earth moon the four galilean moons  saturn titan  and neptune triton  saturn has an additional six mid-sized natural satellites massive enough to have achieved hydrostatic equilibrium  and uranus has five it has been suggested that some satellites may potentially harbour life   among the identified dwarf planets ceres has no known natural satellites pluto has the relatively large natural satellite charon and four smaller natural satellites styx  nix  kerberos  and hydra   haumea has two natural satellites and eris and makemake have one each the plutocharon system is unusual in that the center of mass lies in open space between the two a characteristic sometimes associated with a double-planet system the seven largest natural satellites in the solar system those bigger than  across are jupiter galilean moons  ganymede  callisto  io  and europa  saturn moon titan earth

satellites between  and  across titania  oberon  rhea  iapetus  charon  ariel  umbriel  dione  and tethys  the smallest tethys has more mass than all smaller natural satellites together as well as the natural satellites of the various planets there are also over known natural satellites of the dwarf planets  minor planets and other small solar system bodies  some studies estimate that up to  of all trans-neptunian objects could have satellites the following is a comparative table classifying the natural satellites in the solar system by diameter the column on the right includes some notable

disambiguation international space station earth masses barycenter pluto charon in physics  an orbit is the gravitationally curved trajectory of an object   such as the trajectory of a planet around a star or a natural satellite around a planet normally orbit refers to a regularly repeating trajectory although it may also refer to a non-repeating trajectory to a close approximation planets and satellites follow elliptic orbits  with the center of mass being orbited at a focal point of the ellipse  as described by kepler laws of planetary motion  for most situations orbital motion is adequately approximated by newtonian mechanics  which explains gravity as a force obeying an inverse-square law   however albert einstein general theory of relativity  which accounts for gravity as due to curvature of spacetime  with orbits following geodesics  provides a more accurate calculation and understanding of the exact mechanics of orbital motion contents edit a series spaceflight space

sierra nevada corporation spacex virgin galactic xcor aerospace spaceflight portal historically the apparent motions of the planets were described by european and arabic philosophers using the idea of celestial spheres  this model posited the existence of perfect moving spheres or rings to which the stars and planets were attached it assumed the heavens were fixed apart from the motion of the spheres and was developed without any understanding of gravity after the planets motions were more accurately measured theoretical mechanisms such as deferent and epicycles were added although the model was capable of reasonably accurately predicting the planets positions in the sky more and more epicycles were required as the measurements became more accurate hence the model became increasingly unwieldy originally geocentric  it was modified by copernicus to place the sun at the centre to help simplify the model the model was further challenged during the century as comets were observed traversing the spheres   the basis for the modern understanding of orbits was first formulated by johannes kepler whose results are summarised in his three laws of planetary motion first he found that the orbits of the planets in our solar system are elliptical not circular or epicyclic  as had previously been believed and that the sun is not located at the center of the orbits but rather at one focus   second he found that the orbital speed of each planet is not constant as had previously been thought but rather that the speed depends on the planet distance from the sun third kepler found a universal relationship between the orbital properties of all the planets orbiting the sun for the planets the cubes of their distances from the sun are proportional to the squares of their orbital periods jupiter and venus for example are respectively about  and  au distant from the sun their orbital periods respectively about  and  years the proportionality is seen by the fact that the ratio for jupiter    is practically equal to that for venus    in accord with the relationship idealised orbits meeting these rules are known as kepler orbits  conic sections parabolic hyperbolic escape gravitational potential well isaac newton demonstrated that kepler laws were derivable from his theory of gravitation and that in general the orbits of bodies subject to gravity were conic sections this assumes that the force of gravity propagates instantaneously newton showed that for a pair of bodies the orbits sizes are in inverse proportion to their masses  and that those bodies orbit their common center of mass  where one body is much more massive than the other as is the case of an artificial satellite orbiting a planet it is a convenient approximation to take the center of mass as coinciding with the center of the more massive body advances in newtonian mechanics were then used to explore variations from the simple assumptions behind kepler orbits such as the perturbations due to other bodies or the impact of spheroidal rather than spherical bodies lagrange  developed a new approach to newtonian mechanics emphasizing energy more than force and made progress on the three body problem  discovering the lagrangian points  in a dramatic vindication of classical mechanics in urbain le verrier was able to predict the position of neptune based on unexplained perturbations in the orbit of uranus  albert einstein - in his paper explained that gravity was due to curvature of space-time and removed newton assumption that changes propagate instantaneously this led astronomers to recognize that newtonian mechanics did not provide the highest accuracy in understanding orbits in relativity theory  orbits follow geodesic trajectories which are usually approximated very well by the newtonian predictions except where there are very strong gravity fields and very high speeds but the differences are measurable essentially all the experimental evidence that can distinguish between the theories agrees with relativity theory to within experimental measurement accuracy the original vindication of general relativity is that it was able to account for the remaining unexplained amount in precession of mercury perihelion first noted by le verrier however newton solution is still used for most short term purposes since it is significantly easier to use and sufficiently accurate edit needs additional citations for verification improve this article adding citations to reliable sources learn how and when to remove this template message within a planetary system  planets dwarf planets  asteroids and other minor planets  comets  and space debris orbit the system barycenter in elliptical orbits  a comet in a parabolic or hyperbolic orbit about a barycenter is not gravitationally bound to the star and therefore is not considered part of the star planetary system bodies which are gravitationally bound to one of the planets in a planetary system either natural or artificial satellites  follow orbits about a barycenter near or within that planet owing to mutual gravitational perturbations  the eccentricities of the planetary orbits vary over time mercury  the smallest planet in the solar system has the most eccentric orbit at the present epoch  mars has the next largest eccentricity while the smallest orbital eccentricities are seen with venus and neptune  as two objects orbit each other the periapsis is that point at which the two objects are closest to each other and the apoapsis is that point at which they are the farthest more specific terms are used for specific bodies for example and are the lowest and highest parts of an orbit around earth while and are the closest and farthest points of an orbit around the sun in the case of planets orbiting a star the mass of the star and all its satellites are calculated to be at a single point called the barycenter the paths of all the star satellites are elliptical orbits about that barycenter each satellite in that system will have its own elliptical orbit with the barycenter at one focal point of that ellipse at any point along its orbit any satellite will have a certain value of kinetic and potential energy with respect to the barycenter and that energy is a constant value at every point along its orbit as a result as a planet approaches periapsis  the planet will increase in speed as its potential energy decreases as a planet approaches apoapsis  its velocity will decrease as its potential energy increases edit there are a few common ways of understanding orbits tangential velocity as an illustration of an orbit around a planet the newton cannonball model may prove useful see image below this is a  thought experiment  in which a cannon on top of a tall mountain is able to fire a cannonball horizontally at any chosen muzzle speed the effects of air friction on the cannonball are ignored or perhaps the mountain is high enough that the cannon is above the earth atmosphere which is the same thing  newton cannonball if the cannon fires its ball with a low initial speed the trajectory of the ball curves downward and hits the ground a as the firing speed is increased the cannonball hits the ground farther b away from the cannon because while the ball is still falling towards the ground the ground is increasingly curving away from it see first point above all these motions are actually orbits in a technical sense they are describing a portion of an elliptical path around the center of gravity but the orbits are interrupted by striking the earth if the cannonball is fired with sufficient speed the ground curves away from the ball at least as much as the ball falls so the ball never strikes the ground it is now in what could be called a non-interrupted or circumnavigating orbit for any specific combination of height above the center of gravity and mass of the planet there is one specific firing speed unaffected by the mass of the ball which is assumed to be very small relative to the earth mass that produces a circular orbit  as shown in c as the firing speed is increased beyond this non-interrupted elliptic orbits are produced one is shown in d if the initial firing is above the surface of the earth as shown there will also be non-interrupted elliptical orbits at slower firing speed these will come closest to the earth at the point half an orbit beyond and directly opposite the firing point below the circular orbit at a specific horizontal firing speed called escape velocity  dependent on the mass of the planet an open orbit e is achieved that has a parabolic path  at even greater speeds the object will follow a range of hyperbolic trajectories  in a practical sense both of these trajectory types mean the object is breaking free of the planet gravity and going off into space never to return the velocity relationship of two moving objects with mass can thus be considered in four practical classes with subtypes suborbital trajectories open or escape trajectories it is worth noting that orbital rockets are launched vertically at first to lift the rocket above the atmosphere which causes frictional drag and then slowly pitch over and finish firing the rocket engine parallel to the atmosphere to achieve orbit speed once in orbit their speed keeps them in orbit above the atmosphere if eg an elliptical orbit dips into dense air the object will lose speed and re-enter ie fall occasionally a space craft will intentionally intercept the atmosphere in an act commonly referred to as an aerobraking maneuver edit edit in most situations relativistic effects can be neglected and newton laws give a sufficiently accurate description of motion the acceleration of a body is equal to the sum of the forces acting on it divided by its mass and the gravitational force acting on a body is proportional to the product of the masses of the two attracting bodies and decreases inversely with the square of the distance between them to this newtonian approximation for a system of two-point masses or spherical bodies only influenced by their mutual gravitation called a two-body problem  their trajectories can be exactly calculated if the heavier body is much more massive than the smaller as in the case of a satellite or small moon orbiting a planet or for the earth orbiting the sun it is accurate enough and convenient to describe the motion in terms of a coordinate system that is centered on the heavier body and we say that the lighter body is in orbit around the heavier for the case where the masses of two bodies are comparable an exact newtonian solution is still sufficient and can be had by placing the coordinate system at the center of mass of the system edit energy is associated with gravitational fields  a stationary body far from another can do external work if it is pulled towards it and therefore has gravitational potential energy  since work is required to separate two bodies against the pull of gravity their gravitational potential energy increases as they are separated and decreases as they approach one another for point masses the gravitational energy decreases to zero as they approach zero separation it is convenient and conventional to assign the potential energy as having zero value when they are an infinite distance apart and hence it has a negative value since it decreases from zero for smaller finite distances edit when only two gravitational bodies interact their orbits follow a conic section  the orbit can be open implying the object never returns or closed returning which it is depends on the total energy  kinetic  potential energy  of the system in the case of an open orbit the speed at any position of the orbit is at least the escape velocity for that position in the case of a closed orbit the speed is always less than the escape velocity since the kinetic energy is never negative if the common convention is adopted of taking the potential energy as zero at infinite separation the bound orbits will have negative total energy the parabolic trajectories zero total energy and hyperbolic orbits positive total energy an open orbit will have a parabolic shape if it has velocity of exactly the escape velocity at that point in its trajectory and it will have the shape of a hyperbola when its velocity is greater than the escape velocity when bodies with escape velocity or greater approach each other they will briefly curve around each other at the time of their closest approach and then separate forever all closed orbits have the shape of an ellipse  a circular orbit is a special case wherein the foci of the ellipse coincide the point where the orbiting body is closest to earth is called the perigee  and is called the periapsis less properly perifocus or pericentron when the orbit is about a body other than earth the point where the satellite is farthest from earth is called the apogee  apoapsis or sometimes apifocus or apocentron a line drawn from periapsis to apoapsis is the line-of-apsides  this is the major axis of the ellipse the line through its longest part edit bodies following closed orbits repeat their paths with a certain time called the period this motion is described by the empirical laws of kepler which can be mathematically derived from newton laws these can be
formulated as follows sun barycenter orbital plane perihelion aphelion perigee apogee moon perilune apolune periselene aposelene star periastron apastron orbital plane perihelion aphelion semi-major axis edit note that while bound orbits of a point mass or a spherical body with a newtonian gravitational field are closed ellipses  which repeat the same path exactly and indefinitely any non-spherical or non-newtonian effects such as caused by the slight oblateness of the earth  or by relativistic effects  thereby changing the gravitational field behavior with distance will cause the orbit shape to depart from the closed ellipses characteristic of newtonian two-body motion  the two-body solutions were published by newton in principia in  in  karl fritiof sundman developed a converging infinite series that solves the three-body problem  however it converges too slowly to be of much use except for special cases like the lagrangian points  no method is known to solve the equations of motion for a system with four or more bodies edit rather than an exact closed form solution orbits with many bodies can be approximated with arbitrarily high accuracy these approximations take two forms perturbation tables celestial  secular phenomena post-newtonian differential equation initial value problem differential simulations with large numbers of objects perform the calculations in a hierarchical pairwise fashion between centers of mass using this scheme galaxies star clusters and other large assemblages of objects have been simulated edit kepler orbit orbit equation kepler first law the following derivation applies to such an elliptical orbit we start only with the newtonian law of gravitation stating that the gravitational acceleration towards the central body is related to the inverse of the square of the distance between them namely where is the force acting on the mass caused by the gravitational attraction mass has for  is the universal gravitational constant and is the distance between the two masses centers from newton second law the summation of the forces acting on related to that body acceleration where is the acceleration of caused by the force of gravitational attraction of acting on  combining eq and  solving for the acceleration  where is the standard gravitational parameter  in this case  it is understood that the system being described is  hence the subscripts can be dropped we assume that the central body is massive enough that it can be considered to be stationary and we ignore the more subtle effects of general relativity  when a pendulum or an object attached to a spring swings in an ellipse the inward accelerationforce is proportional to the distance due to the way vectors add the component of the force in the or in the directions are also proportionate to the respective components of the distances  hence the entire analysis can be done separately in these dimensions this results in the harmonic parabolic equations and of the ellipse in contrast with the decreasing relationship  the dimensions cannot be separated the location of the orbiting object at the current time is located in the plane using vector calculus in polar coordinates both with the standard euclidean basis and with the polar basis with the origin coinciding with the center of force let be the distance between the object and the center and be the angle it has rotated let and be the standard euclidean bases and let and be the radial and transverse polar basis with the first being the unit vector pointing from the central body to the current location of the orbiting object and the second being the orthogonal unit vector pointing in the direction that the orbiting object would travel if orbiting in a counter clockwise circle then the vector to the orbiting object is we use and to denote the standard derivatives of how this distance and angle change over time we take the derivative of a vector to see how it changes over time by subtracting its location at time from that at time and dividing by  the result is also a vector because our basis vector moves as the object orbits we start by differentiating it from time to  the vector keeps its beginning at the origin and rotates from angle to which moves its head a distance in the perpendicular direction giving a derivative of  we can now find the velocity and acceleration of our orbiting object the coefficients of and give the accelerations in the radial and transverse directions as said newton gives this first due to gravity is and the second is zero   equation  can be rearranged using integration by parts we can multiply through by because it is not zero unless the orbiting object crashes
then having the derivative be zero gives that the function is a constant  which is actually the theoretical proof of kepler second law a line joining a planet and the sun sweeps out equal areas during equal intervals of time the constant of integration  is the angular momentum per unit mass  in order to get an equation for the orbit from equation  we need to eliminate time  see also binet equation 
in polar coordinates this would express the distance of the orbiting object from the center as a function of its angle  however it is easier to introduce the auxiliary variable and to express as a function of  derivatives of with respect to time may be rewritten as derivatives of with respect to angle plugging these into  gives  so for the gravitational force or more generally for inverse square force law the right hand side of the equation becomes a constant and the equation is seen to be the harmonic equation up to a shift of origin of the dependent variable the solution is where and are arbitrary constants this resulting equation of the orbit of the object is that of an ellipse in polar form relative to one of the focal points this is put into a more standard form by letting be the eccentricity  letting be the semi-major axis finally letting so the long axis of the ellipse is along the positive coordinate when the two-body system is under the influence of torque the angular momentum is not a constant after the following calculation we will get the sturm-liouville equation of two-body system   edit the above classical  newtonian  analysis of orbital mechanics assumes that the more subtle effects of general relativity  such as frame dragging and gravitational time dilation are negligible relativistic effects cease to be negligible when near very massive bodies as with the precession of mercury orbit about the sun or when extreme precision is needed as with calculations of the orbital elements and time signal references for gps satellites   edit orbital plane astronomy the analysis so far has been two dimensional it turns out that an unperturbed orbit is two-dimensional in a plane fixed in space and thus the extension to three dimensions requires simply rotating the two-dimensional plane into the required angle relative to the poles of the planetary body involved the rotation to do this in three dimensions requires three numbers to uniquely determine traditionally these are expressed as three angles edit orbital period the orbital period is simply how long an orbiting body takes to complete one orbit edit orbital trajectory keplerian elements six parameters are required to specify a keplerian orbit about a body for example the three numbers that specify the body initial position and the three values that specify its velocity will define a unique orbit that can be calculated forwards or backwards in time however traditionally the parameters used are slightly different the traditionally used set of orbital elements is called the set of keplerian elements  after johannes kepler and his laws the keplerian elements are six inclination longitude of the ascending node argument of periapsis eccentricity semimajor axis mean anomaly epoch in principle once the orbital elements are known for a body its position can be calculated forward and backwards indefinitely in time however in practice orbits are affected or perturbed  by other forces than simple gravity from an assumed point source see the next section and thus the orbital elements change over time edit an orbital perturbation is when a force or impulse which is much smaller than the overall force or average impulse of the main gravitating body and which is external to the two orbiting bodies causes an acceleration which changes the parameters of the orbit over time edit a small radial impulse given to a body in orbit changes the eccentricity  but not the orbital period to first order a prograde or retrograde impulse ie an impulse applied along the orbital motion changes both the eccentricity and the orbital period  notably a prograde impulse at periapsis raises the altitude at apoapsis  and vice versa and a retrograde impulse does the opposite a transverse impulse out of the orbital plane causes rotation of the orbital plane without changing the period or eccentricity in all instances a closed orbit will still intersect the perturbation point edit orbital decay if an orbit is about a planetary body with significant atmosphere its orbit can decay because of drag  particularly at each periapsis  the object experiences atmospheric drag losing energy each time the orbit grows less eccentric more circular because the object loses kinetic energy precisely when that energy is at its maximum this is similar to the effect of slowing a pendulum at its lowest point the highest point of the pendulum swing becomes lower with each successive slowing more of the orbit path is affected by the atmosphere and the effect becomes more pronounced eventually the effect becomes so great that the maximum kinetic energy is not enough to return the orbit above the limits of the atmospheric drag effect when this happens the body will rapidly spiral down and intersect the central body the bounds of an atmosphere vary wildly during a solar maximum  the earth atmosphere causes drag up to a hundred kilometres higher than during a solar minimum some satellites with long conductive tethers can also experience orbital decay because of electromagnetic drag from the earth magnetic field  as the wire cuts the magnetic field it acts as a generator moving electrons from one end to the other the orbital energy is converted to heat in the wire orbits can be artificially influenced through the use of rocket engines which change the kinetic energy of the body at some point in its path this is the conversion of chemical or electrical energy to kinetic energy in this way changes in the orbit shape or orientation can be facilitated another method of artificially influencing an orbit is through the use of solar sails or magnetic sails  these forms of propulsion require no propellant or energy input other than that of the sun and so can be used indefinitely see statite for one such proposed use orbital decay can occur due to tidal forces for objects below the synchronous orbit for the body they orbiting the gravity of the orbiting object raises tidal bulges in the primary and since below the synchronous orbit the orbiting object is moving faster than the body surface the bulges lag a short angle behind it the gravity of the bulges is slightly off of the primary-satellite axis and thus has a component along the satellite motion the near bulge slows the object more than the far bulge speeds it up and as a result the orbit decays conversely the gravity of the satellite on the bulges applies torque on the primary and speeds up its rotation artificial satellites are too small to have an appreciable tidal effect on the planets they orbit but several moons in the solar system are undergoing orbital decay by this mechanism mars innermost moon phobos is a prime example and is expected to either impact mars surface or break up into a ring within million years orbits can decay via the emission of gravitational waves  this mechanism is extremely weak for most stellar objects only becoming significant in cases where there is a combination of extreme mass and extreme acceleration such as with black holes or neutron stars that are orbiting each other closely edit the standard analysis of orbiting bodies assumes that all bodies consist of uniform spheres or more generally concentric shells each of uniform density it can be shown that such bodies are gravitationally equivalent to point sources however in the real world many bodies rotate and this introduces oblateness and distorts the gravity field and gives a quadrupole moment to the gravitational field which is significant at distances comparable to the radius of the body in the general case the gravitational potential of a rotating body such as eg a planet is usually expanded in multipoles accounting for the departures of it from spherical symmetry from the point of view of satellite dynamics of particular relevance are the so-called even zonal harmonic coefficients or even zonals since they induce secular orbital perturbations which are cumulative over time spans longer than the orbital period    they do depend on the orientation of the body symmetry axis in the space affecting in general the whole orbit with the exception of the semimajor axis edit n-body problem the effects of other gravitating bodies can be significant for example the orbit of the moon cannot be accurately described without allowing for the action of the sun gravity as well as the earth one approximate result is that bodies will usually have reasonably stable orbits around a heavier planet or moon in spite of these perturbations provided they are orbiting well within the heavier body hill sphere  when there are more than two gravitating bodies it is referred to as an n-body problem  most n-body problems have no closed form solution  although some special cases have been formulated edit for smaller bodies particularly light and stellar wind can cause significant perturbations to the attitude and direction of motion of the body and over time can be significant of the planetary bodies the motion of asteroids is particularly affected over large periods when the asteroids are rotating relative to the sun edit mathematicians have discovered that it is possible in principle to have multiple bodies in non-elliptical orbits that repeat periodically although most such orbits are not stable regarding small perturbations in mass position or velocity however some special stable cases have been identified including a planar figure-eight orbit occupied by three moving bodies   further studies have discovered that nonplanar orbits are also possible including one involving masses moving in roughly circular interlocking orbits topologically equivalent to the edges of a cuboctahedron   finding such orbits naturally occurring in the universe is thought to be extremely unlikely because of the improbability of the required conditions occurring by chance  edit orbital mechanics orbital mechanics or astrodynamics is the application of ballistics and celestial mechanics to the practical problems concerning the motion of rockets and other spacecraft  the motion of these objects is usually calculated from newton laws of motion and newton law of universal gravitation  it is a core discipline within space mission design and control celestial mechanics treats more broadly the orbital dynamics of systems under the influence of gravity  including spacecraft and natural astronomical bodies such as star systems planets  moons  and comets  orbital mechanics focuses on spacecraft trajectories  including orbital maneuvers  orbit plane changes and interplanetary transfers and is used by mission planners to predict the results of propulsive maneuvers  general relativity is a more exact theory than newton laws for calculating orbits and is sometimes necessary for greater accuracy or in high-gravity situations such as orbits close to the sun edit gps glonass galileo compass medium earth orbit satellite  system international space station

circular orbit  geosynchronous orbit geostationary orbit sidereal rotation semi-major axis  high earth orbit geocentric orbits geosynchronous orbit km miles  edit the gravitational constant has been calculated as thus the constant has dimension density time  this corresponds to the following properties scaling of distances including sizes of bodies while keeping the densities the same gives similar orbits without scaling the time if for example distances are halved masses are divided by  gravitational forces by and gravitational accelerations by  hence velocities are halved and orbital periods and other travel times related to gravity remain the same for example when an object is dropped from a tower the time it takes to fall to the ground remains the same with a scale model of the tower on a scale model of the earth scaling of distances while keeping the masses the same in the case of point masses or by adjusting the densities gives similar orbits if distances are multiplied by  gravitational forces and accelerations are divided by  velocities are halved and orbital periods are multiplied by  when all densities are multiplied by  orbits are the same gravitational forces are multiplied by and accelerations by  velocities are doubled and orbital periods are halved when all densities are multiplied by  and all sizes are halved orbits are similar masses are divided by  gravitational forces are the same gravitational accelerations are doubled hence velocities are the same and orbital periods are halved in all these cases of scaling if densities are multiplied by  times are halved if velocities are doubled forces are multiplied by  these properties are illustrated in the formula derived from the formula for the orbital period  for an elliptical orbit with semi-major axis  of a small body around a spherical body with radius and average density  where is the orbital period see also kepler third law  edit the application of certain orbits or orbital maneuvers to specific useful purposes have been the subject of patents  edit tidal locking some bodies are tidally locked with other bodies meaning that one side of the celestial body is permanently

disambiguation krmn line the atmosphere international space station outer space is the expanse that exists beyond earth and between celestial bodies  outer space is not completely emptyit is a hard vacuum containing a low density of particles predominantly a plasma of hydrogen and helium  as well as electromagnetic radiation  magnetic fields  neutrinos  dust  and cosmic rays  the baseline temperature of outer space as set by the background radiation from the big bang  is  kelvins    the plasma between galaxies accounts for about half of the baryonic ordinary matter in the universe it has a number density of less than one hydrogen atom per cubic metre and a temperature of millions of kelvins  local concentrations of matter have condensed into stars and galaxies  studies indicate that  of the mass in most galaxies is in an unknown form called dark matter  which interacts with other matter through gravitational but not electromagnetic forces    observations suggest that the majority of the mass-energy in the observable universe is dark energy  a type of vacuum energy that is poorly understood   intergalactic space takes up most of the volume of the universe  but even galaxies and star systems consist almost entirely of empty space outer space does not begin at a definite altitude above the earth surface the krmn line  an altitude of  above sea level   is conventionally used as the start of outer space in space treaties and for aerospace records keeping the framework for international space law was established by the outer space treaty  which entered into force on october  this treaty precludes any claims of national sovereignty and permits all states to freely explore outer space  despite the drafting of un resolutions for the peaceful uses of outer space anti-satellite weapons have been tested in earth orbit humans began the physical exploration of space during the century with the advent of high-altitude balloon flights  this was followed by crewed rocket flights and then crewed earth orbit  first achieved by yuri gagarin of the soviet union in  due to the high cost of getting into space human spaceflight has been limited to low earth orbit and the moon  on the other hand uncrewed spacecraft have reached all of the known planets in the solar system  outer space represents a challenging environment for human exploration because of the hazards of vacuum and radiation  microgravity also has a negative effect on human physiology that causes both muscle atrophy and bone loss  in addition to these health and environmental issues the economic cost of putting objects including humans into space is very high contents metric expansion of space inflation big bang the size of the whole universe is unknown and it might be infinite in extent  according to the big bang theory the very early universe was an extremely hot and dense state about  years ago  which rapidly expanded  about  years later the universe had cooled sufficiently to allow protons and electrons to combine and form hydrogenthe so-called recombination epoch  when this happened matter and energy became decoupled allowing photons to travel freely through the continually expanding space  matter that remained following the initial expansion has since undergone gravitational collapse to create stars  galaxies and other astronomical objects  leaving behind a deep vacuum that forms what is now called outer space  as light has a finite velocity this theory also constrains the size of the directly observable universe  the present day shape of the universe has been determined from measurements of the cosmic microwave background using satellites like the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe  these observations indicate that the spatial geometry of the observable universe is  flat  meaning that photons on parallel paths at one point remain parallel as they travel through space to the limit of the observable universe except for local gravity  the flat universe combined with the measured mass density of the universe and the accelerating expansion of the universe  indicates that space has a non-zero vacuum energy  which is called dark energy   estimates put the average energy density of the present day universe at the equivalent of  protons per cubic meter including dark energy dark matter  and baryonic matter ordinary matter composed of atoms the atoms account for only  of the total energy density or a density of one proton per four cubic meters  the density of the universe is clearly not uniform it ranges from relatively high density in galaxiesincluding very high density in structures within galaxies such as planets stars and black holes to conditions in vast voids that have much lower density at least in terms of visible matter  unlike matter and dark matter dark energy seems not to be concentrated in galaxies although dark energy may account for a majority of the mass-energy in the universe dark energy influence is orders of magnitude smaller than the influence of gravity from matter and dark matter within the milky way  planetary habitability hubble ultra-deep field speed of light history outer space is the closest known approximation to a perfect vacuum  it has effectively no friction  allowing stars planets  and moons to move freely along their ideal orbits  following the initial formation stage the deep vacuum of intergalactic space is not devoid of matter  as it contains a few hydrogen atoms per cubic meter  by comparison the air humans breathe contains about molecules per cubic meter   the low density of matter in outer space means that electromagnetic radiation can travel great distances without being scattered the mean free path of a photon in intergalactic space is about km or light years  in spite of this extinction  which is the absorption and scattering of photons by dust and gas is an important factor in galactic and intergalactic astronomy   stars planets and moons retain their atmospheres by gravitational attraction atmospheres have no clearly delineated upper boundary the density of atmospheric gas gradually decreases with distance from the object until it becomes indistinguishable from outer space  the earth atmospheric pressure drops to about pa at kilometres  miles of altitude  compared to  pa for the international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac definition of standard pressure  above this altitude isotropic gas pressure rapidly becomes insignificant when compared to radiation pressure from the sun and the dynamic pressure of the solar wind  the thermosphere in this range has large gradients of pressure temperature and composition and varies greatly due to space weather   the temperature of outer space is measured in terms of the kinetic activity of the gas as it is on earth the radiation of outer space has a different temperature than the kinetic temperature of the gas meaning that the gas and radiation are not in thermodynamic equilibrium    all of the observable universe is filled with photons that were created during the big bang  which is known as the cosmic microwave background radiation cmb there is quite likely a correspondingly large number of neutrinos called the cosmic neutrino background    the current black body temperature of the background radiation is about k  c  f   the gas temperatures in outer space can vary widely for example the temperature in the boomerang nebula is   while the solar corona reaches temperatures over   magnetic fields have been detected in the space around just about every class of celestial object star formation in spiral galaxies can generate small-scale dynamos  creating turbulent magnetic field strengths of around g  the davisgreenstein effect causes elongated dust grains to align themselves with a galaxy magnetic field resulting in weak optical polarization  this has been used to show ordered magnetic fields exist in several nearby galaxies magneto-hydrodynamic processes in active elliptical galaxies produce their characteristic jets and radio lobes  non-thermal radio sources have been detected even among the most distant high-z sources indicating the presence of magnetic fields  outside a protective atmosphere and magnetic field there are few obstacles to the passage through space of energetic subatomic particles known as cosmic rays these particles have energies ranging from about ev up to an extreme ev of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays   the peak flux of cosmic rays occurs at energies of about ev with approximately  protons  helium nuclei and  heavier nuclei in the high energy range the flux of electrons is only about  of that of protons  cosmic rays can damage electronic components and pose a health threat to space travelers  according to astronauts like don pettit  space has a burnedmetallic odor that clings to their suits and equipment similar to the scent of an arc welding torch   astrobiology astrobotany plants in space animals in space effect of spaceflight on the human body bioastronautics weightlessness space suit despite the harsh environment several life forms have been found that can withstand extreme space conditions for extended periods species of lichen carried on the esa biopan facility survived exposure for ten days in   seeds of arabidopsis thaliana and nicotiana tabacum germinated after being exposed to space for  years  a strain of bacillus subtilis has survived days when exposed to low-earth orbit or a simulated martian environment  the lithopanspermia hypothesis suggests that rocks ejected into outer space from life-harboring planets may successfully transport life forms to another habitable world a conjecture is that just such a scenario occurred early in the history of the solar system with potentially microorganism -bearing rocks being exchanged between venus earth and mars  even at relatively low altitudes in the earth atmosphere conditions are hostile to the human body the altitude where atmospheric pressure matches the vapor pressure of water at the temperature of the human body is called the armstrong line  named after american physician harry g armstrong  it is located at an altitude of around   at or above the armstrong line fluids in the throat and lungs boil away more specifically exposed bodily liquids such as saliva tears and liquids in the lungs boil away hence at this altitude human survival requires a pressure suit or a pressurized capsule  out in space sudden exposure of an unprotected human to very low pressure  such as during a rapid decompression can cause pulmonary barotrauma a rupture of the lungs due to the large pressure differential between inside and outside the chest even if the subject airway is fully open the flow of air through the windpipe may be too slow to prevent the rupture  rapid decompression can rupture eardrums and sinuses bruising and blood seep can occur in soft tissues and shock can cause an increase in oxygen consumption that leads to hypoxia  as a consequence of rapid decompression oxygen dissolved in the blood empties into the lungs to try to equalize the partial pressure gradient once the deoxygenated blood arrives at the brain humans lose consciousness after a few seconds and die of hypoxia within minutes  blood and other body fluids boil when the pressure drops below  and this condition is called ebullism   the steam may bloat the body to twice its normal size and slow circulation but tissues are elastic and porous enough to prevent rupture ebullism is slowed by the pressure containment of blood vessels so some blood remains liquid   swelling and ebullism can be reduced by containment in a pressure suit  the crew altitude protection suit caps a fitted elastic garment designed in the for astronauts prevents ebullism at pressures as low as kpa  supplemental oxygen is needed at  to provide enough oxygen for breathing and to prevent water loss while above  pressure suits are essential to prevent ebullism  most space suits use around of pure oxygen about the same as on the earth surface this pressure is high enough to prevent ebullism but evaporation of nitrogen dissolved in the blood could still cause decompression sickness and gas embolisms if not managed  humans evolved for life in earth gravity  and exposure to weightlessness has been shown to have deleterious effects on human health initially more than  of astronauts experience space motion sickness  this can cause nausea and vomiting  vertigo  headaches lethargy  and overall malaise the duration of space sickness varies but it typically lasts for days after which the body adjusts to the new environment longer-term exposure to weightlessness results in muscle atrophy and deterioration of the skeleton  or spaceflight osteopenia  these effects can be minimized through a regimen of exercise  other effects include fluid redistribution slowing of the cardiovascular system  decreased production of red blood cells  balance disorders and a weakening of the immune system  lesser symptoms include loss of body mass nasal congestion sleep disturbance and puffiness of the face  during long-duration space travel radiation can pose an acute health hazard 
exposure to high-energy ionizing cosmic rays can result in fatigue nausea vomiting as well as damage to the immune system and changes to the white blood cell count over longer durations symptoms include an increased risk of cancer  plus damage to the eyes  nervous system  lungs and the gastrointestinal tract   on a round-trip mars mission lasting three years a large fraction of the cells in an astronaut body would be traversed and potentially damaged by high energy nuclei  the energy of such particles is significantly diminished by the shielding provided by the walls of a spacecraft and can be further diminished by water containers and other barriers the impact of the cosmic rays upon the shielding produces additional radiation that can affect the crew further re is needed to assess the radiation hazards and determine suitable countermeasures  space is a partial vacuum its different regions are defined by the various atmospheres and winds that dominate within them and extend to the point at which those winds give way to those beyond geospace extends from earth atmosphere to the outer reaches of earth magnetic field whereupon it gives way to the solar wind of interplanetary space  interplanetary space extends to the heliopause whereupon the solar wind gives way to the winds of the interstellar medium   interstellar space then continues to the edges of the galaxy where it fades into the intergalactic void  aurora australis space shuttle discovery sts- geospace is the region of outer space near earth including the upper atmosphere and magnetosphere   the van allen radiation belts lie within the geospace the outer boundary of geospace is the magnetopause  which forms an interface between the earth magnetosphere and the solar wind the inner boundary is the ionosphere   the variable space-weather conditions of geospace are affected by the behavior of the sun and the solar wind the subject of geospace is interlinked with heliophysics the study of the sun and its impact on the planets of the solar system  the day-side magnetopause is compressed by solar-wind pressurethe subsolar distance from the center of the earth is typically earth radii on the night side the solar wind stretches the magnetosphere to form a magnetotail that sometimes extends out to more than earth radii   for roughly four days of each month the lunar surface is shielded from the solar wind as the moon passes through the magnetotail  geospace is populated by electrically charged particles at very low densities the motions of which are controlled by the earth magnetic field  these plasmas form a medium from which storm-like disturbances powered by the solar wind can drive electrical currents into the earth upper atmosphere geomagnetic storms can disturb two regions of geospace the radiation belts and the ionosphere these storms increase fluxes of energetic electrons that can permanently damage satellite electronics interfering with shortwave radio communication and gps location and timing  magnetic storms can also be a hazard to astronauts even in low earth orbit they also create aurorae seen at high latitudes in an oval surrounding the geomagnetic poles   although it meets the definition of outer space the atmospheric density within the first few hundred kilometers above the krmn line is still sufficient to produce significant drag on satellites   this region contains material left over from previous crewed and uncrewed launches that are a potential hazard to spacecraft some of this debris re-enters earth atmosphere periodically  lunar gateway earth gravity keeps the moon in orbit at an average distance of   the region outside earth atmosphere and extending out to just beyond the moon orbit  including the lagrange points  is sometimes referred to as cislunar space   deep space is defined by the united states government and others as any region beyond cislunar space     the international telecommunication union responsible for radio communication including satellites defines the beginning of deep space at about times that distance    the region where earth gravity remains dominant against gravitational perturbations from the sun is called the hill sphere   this extends into translunar space to a distance of roughly  of the mean distance from earth to the sun  or   interplanetary medium comet halebopp solar radiation interplanetary space is defined by the solar wind a continuous stream of charged particles emanating from the sun that creates a very tenuous atmosphere the heliosphere  for billions of kilometers into space this wind has a particle density of protons cm and is moving at a velocity of s   interplanetary space extends out to the heliopause where the influence of the galactic environment starts to dominate over the magnetic field and particle flux from the sun  the distance and strength of the heliopause varies depending on the activity level of the solar wind  the heliopause in turn deflects away low-energy galactic cosmic rays with this modulation effect peaking during solar maximum  the volume of interplanetary space is a nearly total vacuum with a mean free path of about one astronomical unit at the orbital distance of the earth this space is not completely empty and is sparsely filled with cosmic rays which include ionized atomic nuclei and various subatomic particles there is also gas plasma and dust  small meteors  and several dozen types of organic molecules discovered to date by microwave spectroscopy   a cloud of interplanetary dust is visible at night as a faint band called the zodiacal light   interplanetary space contains the magnetic field generated by the sun  there are also magnetospheres generated by planets such as jupiter saturn mercury and the earth that have their own magnetic fields these are shaped by the influence of the solar wind into the approximation of a teardrop shape with the long tail extending outward behind the planet these magnetic fields can trap particles from the solar wind and other sources creating belts of charged particles such as the van allen radiation belts planets without magnetic fields such as mars have their atmospheres gradually eroded by the solar wind  interstellar medium interstellar space bow shock magnetosphere ll orionis orion nebula interstellar space is the physical space within a galaxy beyond the influence each star has upon the encompassed plasma  the contents of interstellar space are called the interstellar medium approximately  of the mass of the interstellar medium consists of lone hydrogen atoms most of the remainder consists of helium atoms this is enriched with trace amounts of heavier atoms formed through stellar nucleosynthesis  these atoms are ejected into the interstellar medium by stellar winds or when evolved stars begin to shed their outer envelopes such as during the formation of a planetary nebula   the cataclysmic explosion of a supernova generates an expanding shock wave consisting of ejected materials that further enrich the medium  the density of matter in the interstellar medium can vary considerably the average is around particles per m   but cold molecular clouds can hold per m    a number of molecules exist in interstellar space as can tiny  m dust particles  the tally of molecules discovered through radio astronomy is steadily increasing at the rate of about four new species per year large regions of higher density matter known as molecular clouds allow chemical reactions to occur including the formation of organic polyatomic species much of this chemistry is driven by collisions energetic cosmic rays penetrate the cold dense clouds and ionize hydrogen and helium resulting for example in the trihydrogen cation  an ionized helium atom can then split relatively abundant carbon monoxide to produce ionized carbon which in turn can lead to organic chemical reactions  the local interstellar medium is a region of space within parsecs pc of the sun which is of interest both for its proximity and for its interaction with the solar system this volume nearly coincides with a region of space known as the local bubble  which is characterized by a lack of dense cold clouds it forms a cavity in the orion arm of the milky way galaxy with dense molecular clouds lying along the borders such as those in the constellations of ophiuchus and taurus  the actual distance to the border of this cavity varies from to or more this volume contains about stars and the local interstellar gas counterbalances the astrospheres that surround these stars with the volume of each sphere varying depending on the local density of the interstellar medium the local bubble contains dozens of warm interstellar clouds with temperatures of up to  and radii of   when stars are moving at sufficiently high peculiar velocities  their astrospheres can generate bow shocks as they collide with the interstellar medium for decades it was assumed that the sun had a bow shock in  data from interstellar boundary explorer ibex and nasa voyager probes showed that the sun bow shock does not exist instead these authors argue that a subsonic bow wave defines the transition from the solar wind flow to the interstellar medium   a bow shock is the third boundary of an astrosphere after the termination shock and the astropause called the heliopause in the solar system  matter cosmic voids a star large magellanic cloud milky way warmhot intergalactic medium intracluster medium intergalactic dust intergalactic space is the physical space between galaxies studies of the large scale distribution of galaxies show that the universe has a foam-like structure with groups and clusters of galaxies lying along filaments that occupy about a tenth of the total space the remainder forms huge voids that are mostly empty of galaxies typically a void spans a distance of  mpc where is the hubble constant in units of  or the dimensionless hubble constant   surrounding and stretching between galaxies there is a rarefied plasma  that is organized in a galactic filamentary structure  this material is called the intergalactic medium igm the density of the igm is times the average density of the universe  it consists mostly of ionized hydrogen ie a plasma consisting of equal numbers of electrons and protons as gas falls into the intergalactic medium from the voids it heats up to temperatures of k to k  which is high enough so that collisions between atoms have enough energy to cause the bound electrons to escape from the hydrogen nuclei this is why the igm is ionized at these temperatures it is called the warmhot intergalactic medium whim although the plasma is very hot by terrestrial standards k is often called warm in astrophysics computer simulations and observations indicate that up to half of the atomic matter in the universe might exist in this warmhot rarefied state    when gas falls from the filamentary structures of the whim into the galaxy clusters at the intersections of the cosmic filaments it can heat up even more reaching temperatures of k and above in the so-called intracluster medium icm  geocentric orbit a spacecraft enters orbit when its centripetal acceleration due to gravity is less than or equal to the centrifugal acceleration due to the horizontal component of its velocity for a low earth orbit  this velocity is about s h   by contrast the fastest piloted airplane speed ever achieved excluding speeds achieved by deorbiting spacecraft was s h  in by the north american x-   to achieve an orbit a spacecraft must travel faster than a sub-orbital spaceflight  the energy required to reach earth orbital velocity at an altitude of  is about mj kg which is six times the energy needed merely to climb to the corresponding altitude  spacecraft with a perigee below about   are subject to drag from the earth atmosphere  which decreases the orbital altitude the rate of orbital decay depends on the satellite cross-sectional area and mass as well as variations in the air density of the upper atmosphere below about  decay becomes more rapid with lifetimes measured in days once a satellite descends to  it has only hours before it vaporizes in the atmosphere  the escape velocity required to pull free of earth gravitational field altogether and move into interplanetary space is about s h   observable universe spaceshipone human private spaceflight  there is no clear boundary between earth atmosphere and space as the density of the atmosphere gradually decreases as the altitude increases there are several standard boundary designations namely fdration aronautique internationale krmn line theodore von krmn orbital velocity aerodynamic lift   astronauts  nasa re-entry atmospheric drag  in  scientists reported detailed measurements with a supra-thermal ion imager an instrument that measures the direction and speed of ions which allowed them to establish a boundary at  above earth the boundary represents the midpoint of a gradual transition over tens of kilometers from the relatively gentle winds of the earth atmosphere to the more violent flows of charged particles in space which can reach speeds well over s    space law bogota declaration sm- missile reconnaissance satellite usa- the outer space treaty provides the basic framework for international space law it covers the legal use of outer space by nation states and includes in its definition of the moon and other celestial bodies the treaty states that outer space is free for all nation states to explore and is not subject to claims of national sovereignty  calling outer space the province of all mankind this status as a common heritage of mankind has been used though not without opposition to enforce the right to access and shared use of outer space for all nations equally particularly non-spacefaring nations  it also prohibits the development of nuclear weapons in outer space the treaty was passed by the united nations general assembly in and signed in by the ussr the united states of america and the united kingdom as of  state parties have either ratified or acceded to the treaty an additional states signed the treaty without ratifying it   since  outer space has been the subject of multiple united nations resolutions of these more than have been concerning the international co-operation in the peaceful uses of outer space and preventing an arms race in space  four additional space law treaties have been negotiated and drafted by the un committee on the peaceful uses of outer space  still there remains no legal prohibition against deploying conventional weapons in space and anti-satellite weapons have been successfully tested by the us ussr china  and in  india  the moon treaty turned the jurisdiction of all heavenly bodies including the orbits around such bodies over to the international community the treaty has not been ratified by any nation that currently practices human spaceflight  in  eight equatorial states  ecuador  colombia  brazil  congo  zaire  uganda  kenya  and indonesia  met in bogot  colombia with their  declaration of the first meeting of equatorial countries or the bogot declaration  they claimed control of the segment of the geosynchronous orbital path corresponding to each country  these claims are not internationally accepted  space science in bce greek philosopher aristotle suggested that  a principle that became known as the horror vacui  this concept built upon a -century bce ontological argument by the greek philosopher parmenides  who denied the possible existence of a void in space  based on this idea that a vacuum could not exist in the west it was widely held for many centuries that space could not be empty  as late as the century the french philosopher ren descartes argued that the entirety of space must be filled  in ancient china  the -century astronomer zhang heng became convinced that space must be infinite extending well beyond the mechanism that supported the sun and the stars the surviving books of the hsan yeh school said that the heavens were boundless empty and void of substance likewise the sun moon and the company of stars float in the empty space moving or standing still  the italian scientist galileo galilei knew that air had mass and so was subject to gravity in  he demonstrated that an established force resisted the formation of a vacuum it would remain for his pupil evangelista torricelli to create an apparatus that would produce a partial vacuum in  this experiment resulted in the first mercury barometer and created a scientific sensation in europe the french mathematician blaise pascal reasoned that if the column of mercury was supported by air then the column ought to be shorter at higher altitude where the air pressure is lower  in  his brother-in-law florin prier repeated the experiment on the puy de dme mountain in central france and found that the column was shorter by three inches this decrease in pressure was further demonstrated by carrying a half-full balloon up a mountain and watching it gradually expand then contract upon descent  magdeburg hemispheres in  german scientist otto von guericke constructed the first vacuum pump a device that would further refute the principle of  he correctly noted that the atmosphere of the earth surrounds the planet like a shell with the density gradually declining with altitude he concluded that there must be a vacuum between the earth and the moon  back in the century german theologian nicolaus cusanus speculated that the universe lacked a center and a circumference he believed that the universe while not infinite could not be held as finite as it lacked any bounds within which it could be contained  these ideas led to speculations as to the infinite dimension of space by the italian philosopher giordano bruno in the century he extended the copernican heliocentric cosmology to the concept of an infinite universe filled with a substance he called aether  which did not resist the motion of heavenly bodies  english philosopher william gilbert arrived at a similar conclusion arguing that the stars are visible to us only because they are surrounded by a thin aether or a void  this concept of an aether originated with ancient greek philosophers including aristotle who conceived of it as the medium through which the heavenly bodies move  the concept of a universe filled with a luminiferous aether retained support among some scientists until the early century this form of aether was viewed as the medium through which light could propagate  in  the michelsonmorley experiment tried to detect the earth motion through this medium by looking for changes in the speed of light depending on the direction of the planet motion the null result indicated something was wrong with the concept the idea of the luminiferous aether was then abandoned it was replaced by albert einstein theory of special relativity  which holds that the speed of light in a vacuum is a fixed constant independent of the observer motion or frame of reference    the first professional astronomer to support the concept of an infinite universe was the englishman thomas digges in   but the scale of the universe remained unknown until the first successful measurement of the distance to a nearby star in by the german astronomer friedrich bessel  he showed that the star system cygni had a parallax of just  arcseconds compared to the modern value of  this corresponds to a distance of over light years   in  heber curtis noted that novae in spiral nebulae were on average magnitudes fainter than galactic novae suggesting that the former are times further away  the distance to the andromeda galaxy was determined in by american astronomer edwin hubble by measuring the brightness of cepheid variables in that galaxy a new technique discovered by henrietta leavitt   this established that the andromeda galaxy and by extension all galaxies lay well outside the milky way   the modern concept of outer space is based on the big bang cosmology  first proposed in by the belgian physicist georges lematre   this theory holds that the universe originated from a very dense form that has since undergone continuous expansion  the earliest known estimate of the temperature of outer space was by the swiss physicist charles  guillaume in  using the estimated radiation of the background stars he concluded that space must be heated to a temperature of  british physicist arthur eddington made a similar calculation to derive a temperature of  in  german physicist erich regener used the total measured energy of cosmic rays to estimate an intergalactic temperature of  in   american physicists ralph alpher and robert herman predicted for the temperature of space in  based on the gradual decrease in background energy following the then-new big bang theory  the modern measurement of the cosmic microwave background is about  the term was used in by the english poet lady emmeline stuart-wortley in her poem the maiden of moscow  the expression was used as an astronomical term by alexander von humboldt in   it was later popularized in the writings of h g wells in   the shorter term is older first used to mean the region beyond earth sky in john milton paradise lost in    space exploration human presence in space astronautics spaceflight benefits of space exploration earth observation commercialization of space human spaceflight space habitation william anders apollo  for most of human history space was explored by observations made from the earth surfaceinitially with the unaided eye and then with the telescope before reliable rocket technology the closest that humans had come to reaching outer space was through balloon flights in  the us explorer ii crewed balloon flight reached an altitude of   this was greatly exceeded in when the third launch of the german a- rocket climbed to an altitude of about  in  the uncrewed satellite sputnik was launched by a russian r- rocket  achieving earth orbit at an altitude of kilometres   this was followed by the first human spaceflight in  when yuri gagarin was sent into orbit on vostok  the first humans to escape low-earth orbit were frank borman  jim lovell and william anders in on board the us apollo  which achieved lunar orbit  and reached a maximum distance of   from the earth  the first spacecraft to reach escape velocity was the soviet luna  which performed a fly-by of the moon in   in  venera became the first planetary probe it revealed the presence of the solar wind and performed the first fly-by of venus  although contact was lost before reaching venus the first successful planetary mission was the fly-by of venus by mariner   the first fly-by of mars was by mariner in  since that time uncrewed spacecraft have successfully examined each of the solar system planets as well their moons and many minor planets and comets they remain a fundamental tool for the exploration of outer space as well as for observation of the earth  in august  voyager became the first man-made object to leave the solar system and enter interstellar space   the absence of air makes outer space an ideal location for astronomy at all wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum  this is evidenced by the spectacular pictures sent back by the hubble space telescope  allowing light from more than years agoalmost to the time of the big bangto be observed  not every location in space is ideal for a telescope the interplanetary zodiacal dust emits a diffuse near-infrared radiation that can mask the emission of faint sources such as extrasolar planets moving an infrared telescope out past the dust increases its effectiveness  likewise a site like the daedalus crater on the far side of the moon could shield a radio telescope from the radio frequency interference that hampers earth-based observations  uncrewed spacecraft in earth orbit are an essential technology of modern civilization they allow direct monitoring of weather conditions  relay long-range communications like television provide a means of precise   and allow remote sensing of the earth the latter role serves a wide variety of purposes including tracking soil moisture for agriculture prediction of water outflow from seasonal snow packs detection of diseases in plants and trees and surveillance of military activities  the deep vacuum of space could make it an attractive environment for certain industrial processes such as those requiring ultraclean surfaces  like asteroid mining  space manufacturing would require a large financial investment with little prospect of immediate return  an important factor in the total expense is the high cost of placing mass into earth orbit  per kg according to a estimate allowing for inflation since then  the cost of access to space has declined since  partially reusable rockets such as the falcon have lowered access to space below dollars per kilogram with these new rockets the cost to send materials into space remains prohibitively high for many industries proposed concepts for addressing this issue include fully reusable launch systems  non-rocket spacelaunch  momentum exchange tethers  and space elevators   interstellar travel for a human crew remains at present only a theoretical possibility the distances to the nearest stars mean it would require new technological developments and the ability to safely sustain crews for journeys lasting several decades for example the daedalus project study which proposed a spacecraft powered by the fusion of deuterium and helium-  would require years to reach the nearby alpha centauri system other proposed interstellar propulsion systems include light sails  ramjets  and beam-powered propulsion  more advanced propulsion systems could use antimatter as a fuel potentially

of the big bang theory timeline of cosmological theories category astronomy portal physical cosmology is a branch of cosmology concerned with the study of cosmological models a cosmological model  or simply cosmology  provides a description of the largest-scale structures and dynamics of the universe and allows study of fundamental questions about its origin structure evolution and ultimate fate  cosmology as a science originated with the copernican principle  which implies that celestial bodies obey identical physical laws to those on earth and newtonian mechanics  which first allowed those physical laws to be understood physical cosmology as it is now understood began with the development in of albert einstein general theory of relativity  followed by major observational discoveries in the  first edwin hubble discovered that the universe contains a huge number of external galaxies beyond the milky way  then work by vesto slipher and others showed that the universe is expanding  these advances made it possible to speculate about the origin of the universe  and allowed the establishment of the big bang theory by georges lematre  as the leading cosmological model a few reers still advocate a handful of alternative cosmologies   however most cosmologists agree that the big bang theory best explains the observations dramatic advances in observational cosmology since the  including the cosmic microwave background  distant supernovae and galaxy redshift surveys  have led to the development of a standard model of cosmology  this model requires the universe to contain large amounts of dark matter and dark energy whose nature is currently not well understood but the model gives detailed predictions that are in excellent agreement with many diverse observations  cosmology draws heavily on the work of many disparate areas of re in theoretical and applied physics  areas relevant to cosmology include particle physics experiments and theory  theoretical and observational astrophysics  general relativity  quantum mechanics  and plasma physics  contents edit nature timeline single-celled life photosynthesis multicellular life earliest universe earliest

multicellular life earliest fungi sexual reproduction earliest animals plants cambrian explosion earliest mammals earliest apes humans l i f e billion years ago timeline of cosmology list of cosmologists modern cosmology developed along tandem tracks of theory and observation in  albert einstein published his theory of general relativity  which provided a unified description of gravity as a geometric property of space and time  at the time einstein believed in a static universe  but found that his original formulation of the theory did not permit it  this is because masses distributed throughout the universe gravitationally attract and move toward each other over time  however he realized that his equations permitted the introduction of a constant term which could counteract the attractive force of gravity on the cosmic scale einstein published his first paper on relativistic cosmology in  in which he added this cosmological constant to his field equations in order to force them to model a static universe  the einstein model describes a static universe space is finite and unbounded analogous to the surface of a sphere which has a finite area but no edges however this so-called einstein model is unstable to small perturbationsit will eventually start to expand or contract  it was later realized that einstein model was just one of a larger set of possibilities all of which were consistent with general relativity and the cosmological principle the cosmological solutions of general relativity were found by alexander friedmann in the early   his equations describe the friedmannlematrerobertsonwalker universe which may expand or contract and whose geometry may be open flat or closed universe gravitational waves cosmic inflation faster-than-light big bang    in the  vesto slipher and later carl wilhelm wirtz  interpreted the red shift of spiral nebulae as a doppler shift that indicated they were receding from earth   however it is difficult to determine the distance to astronomical objects one way is to compare the physical size of an object to its angular size  but a physical size must be assumed to do this another method is to measure the brightness of an object and assume an intrinsic luminosity  from which the distance may be determined using the inverse-square law  due to the difficulty of using these methods they did not realize that the nebulae were actually galaxies outside our own milky way  nor did they speculate about the cosmological implications in  the belgian roman catholic priest georges lematre independently derived the friedmannlematrerobertsonwalker equations and proposed on the basis of the recession of spiral nebulae that the universe began with the explosion of a primeval atom   which was later called the big bang  in  edwin hubble provided an observational basis for lematre theory hubble showed that the spiral nebulae were galaxies by determining their distances using measurements of the brightness of cepheid variable stars he discovered a relationship between the redshift of a galaxy and its distance he interpreted this as evidence that the galaxies are receding from earth in every direction at speeds proportional to their distance  this fact is now known as hubble law  though the numerical factor hubble found relating recessional velocity and distance was off by a factor of ten due to not knowing about the types of cepheid variables given the cosmological principle  hubble law suggested that the universe was expanding two primary explanations were proposed for the expansion one was lematre big bang theory advocated and developed by george gamow the other explanation was fred hoyle steady state model in which new matter is created as the galaxies move away from each other in this model the universe is roughly the same at any point in time   for a number of years support for these theories was evenly divided however the observational evidence began to support the idea that the universe evolved from a hot dense state the discovery of the cosmic microwave background in lent strong support to the big bang model  and since the precise measurements of the cosmic microwave background by the cosmic background explorer in the early  few cosmologists have seriously proposed other theories of the origin and evolution of the cosmos one consequence of this is that in standard general relativity the universe began with a singularity  as demonstrated by roger penrose and stephen hawking in the   an alternative view to extend the big bang model suggesting the universe had no beginning or singularity and the age of the universe is infinite has been presented    edit the lightest chemical elements  primarily hydrogen and helium  were created during the big bang through the process of nucleosynthesis   in a sequence of stellar nucleosynthesis reactions smaller atomic nuclei are then combined into larger atomic nuclei ultimately forming stable iron group elements such as iron and nickel  which have the highest nuclear binding energies   the net process results in a  meaning subsequent to the big bang  such reactions of nuclear particles can lead to from cataclysmic variable stars such as novae  gravitational collapse of matter into black holes also powers the most energetic processes generally seen in the nuclear regions of galaxies forming quasars and active galaxies  cosmologists cannot explain all cosmic phenomena exactly such as those related to the accelerating expansion of the universe  using conventional forms of energy  instead cosmologists propose a new form of energy called dark energy that permeates all space  one hypothesis is that dark energy is just the vacuum energy  a component of empty space that is associated with the virtual particles that exist due to the uncertainty principle   there is no clear way to define the total energy in the universe using the most widely accepted theory of gravity general relativity  therefore it remains controversial whether the total energy is conserved in an expanding universe for instance each photon that travels through intergalactic space loses energy due to the redshift effect this energy is not obviously transferred to any other system so seems to be permanently lost on the other hand some cosmologists insist that energy is conserved in some sense this follows the law of conservation of energy   different forms of energy may dominate the cosmos relativistic particles which are referred to as radiation  or non-relativistic particles referred to as matter relativistic particles are particles whose rest mass is zero or negligible compared to their kinetic energy  and so move at the speed of light or very close to it non-relativistic particles have much higher rest mass than their energy and so move much slower than the speed of light as the universe expands both matter and radiation become diluted however the energy densities of radiation and matter dilute at different rates as a particular volume expands mass-energy density is changed only by the increase in volume but the energy density of radiation is changed both by the increase in volume and by the increase in the wavelength of the photons that make it up thus the energy of radiation becomes a smaller part of the universe total energy than that of matter as it expands the very early universe is said to have been dominated and radiation controlled the deceleration of expansion later as the average energy per photon becomes roughly ev and lower matter dictates the rate of deceleration and the universe is said to be dominated the intermediate case is not treated well analytically  as the expansion of the universe continues matter dilutes even further and the cosmological constant becomes dominant leading to an acceleration in the universe expansion edit timeline of the big bang the history of the universe is a central issue in cosmology the history of the universe is divided into different periods called epochs according to the dominant forces and processes in each period the standard cosmological model is known as the lambda-cdm model  edit friedmannlematrerobertsonwalker metric within the standard cosmological model  the equations of motion governing the universe as a whole are derived from general relativity with a small positive cosmological constant   the solution is an expanding universe due to this expansion the radiation and matter in the universe cool down and become diluted at first the expansion is slowed down by gravitation attracting the radiation and matter in the universe however as these become diluted the cosmological constant becomes more dominant and the expansion of the universe starts to accelerate rather than decelerate in our universe this happened billions of years ago  edit particle physics in cosmology during the earliest moments of the universe the average energy density was very high making knowledge of particle physics critical to understanding this environment hence scattering processes and decay of unstable elementary particles are important for cosmological models of this period as a rule of thumb a scattering or a decay process is cosmologically important in a certain epoch if the time scale describing that process is smaller than or comparable to the time scale of the expansion of the universe the time scale that describes the expansion of the universe is with being the hubble parameter  which varies with time the expansion timescale is roughly equal to the age of the universe at each point in time edit timeline of the big bang observations suggest that the universe began around  billion years ago  since then the evolution of the universe has passed through three phases the very early universe which is still poorly understood was the split second in which the universe was so hot that particles had energies higher than those currently accessible in particle accelerators on earth therefore while the basic features of this epoch have been worked out in the big bang theory the details are largely based on educated guesses
following this in the early universe the evolution of the universe proceeded according to known high energy physics  this is when the first protons electrons and neutrons formed then nuclei and finally atoms with the formation of neutral hydrogen the cosmic microwave background was emitted finally the epoch of structure formation began when matter started to aggregate into the first stars and quasars  and ultimately galaxies clusters of galaxies and superclusters formed the future of the universe is not yet firmly known but according to the cdm model it will continue expanding forever edit below some of the most active areas of inquiry in cosmology are described in roughly chronological order this does not include all of the big bang cosmology which is presented in timeline of the big bang edit the early hot universe appears to be well explained by the big bang from roughly seconds onwards but there are several problems  one is that there is no compelling reason using current particle physics for the universe to be flat  homogeneous and isotropic cosmological principle  moreover grand unified theories of particle physics suggest that there should be magnetic monopoles in the universe which have not been found these problems are resolved by a brief period of cosmic inflation  which drives the universe to flatness  smooths out anisotropies and inhomogeneities to the observed level and exponentially dilutes the monopoles  the physical model behind cosmic inflation is extremely simple but it has not yet been confirmed by particle physics and there are difficult problems reconciling inflation and quantum field theory  some cosmologists think that string theory and brane cosmology will provide an alternative to inflation  another major problem in cosmology is what caused the universe to contain far more matter than antimatter  cosmologists can observationally deduce that the universe is not split into regions of matter and antimatter if it were there would be x-rays and gamma rays produced as a result of annihilation  but this is not observed therefore some process in the early universe must have created a small excess of matter over antimatter and this currently not understood process is called baryogenesis  three required conditions for baryogenesis were derived by andrei sakharov in  and requires a violation of the particle physics symmetry  called cp-symmetry  between matter and antimatter  however particle accelerators measure too small a violation of cp-symmetry to account for the baryon asymmetry cosmologists and particle physicists look for additional violations of the cp-symmetry in the early universe that might account for the baryon asymmetry  both the problems of baryogenesis and cosmic inflation are very closely related to particle physics and their resolution might come from high energy theory and experiment  rather than through observations of the universe edit big bang nucleosynthesis big bang nucleosynthesis is the theory of the formation of the elements in the early universe it finished when the universe was about three minutes old and its temperature dropped below that at which nuclear fusion could occur big bang nucleosynthesis had a brief period during which it could operate so only the very lightest elements were produced starting from hydrogen ions  protons  it principally produced deuterium  helium-  and lithium  other elements were produced in only trace abundances the basic theory of nucleosynthesis was developed in by george gamow  ralph asher alpher  and robert herman   it was used for many years as a probe of physics at the time of the big bang as the theory of big bang nucleosynthesis connects the abundances of primordial light elements with the features of the early universe  specifically it can be used to test the equivalence principle   to probe dark matter  and test neutrino physics  some cosmologists have proposed that big bang nucleosynthesis suggests there is a fourth sterile species of neutrino  edit the cdm  lambda cold dark matter  or lambda-cdm model is a parametrization of the big bang cosmological model in which the universe contains a cosmological constant  denoted by lambda  greek  associated with dark energy  and cold dark matter abbreviated cdm  it is frequently referred to as the standard model of big bang cosmology   edit cosmic microwave background the cosmic microwave background is radiation left over from decoupling after the epoch of recombination when neutral atoms first formed at this point radiation produced in the big bang stopped thomson scattering from charged ions the radiation first observed in by arno penzias and robert woodrow wilson  has a perfect thermal black-body spectrum it has a temperature of  kelvins today and is isotropic to one part in  cosmological perturbation theory  which describes the evolution of slight inhomogeneities in the early universe has allowed cosmologists to precisely calculate the angular power spectrum of the radiation and it has been measured by the recent satellite experiments  cobe and wmap   and many ground and balloon-based experiments such as degree angular scale interferometer  cosmic background imager  and boomerang   one of the goals of these efforts is to measure the basic parameters of the lambda-cdm model with increasing accuracy as well as to test the predictions of the big bang model and look for new physics the results of measurements made by wmap for example have placed limits on the neutrino masses  newer experiments such as quiet and the atacama cosmology telescope  are trying to measure the polarization of the cosmic microwave background  these measurements are expected to provide further confirmation of the theory as well as information about cosmic inflation and the so-called secondary anisotropies  such as the sunyaev-zel effect and sachs-wolfe effect  which are caused by interaction between galaxies and clusters with the cosmic microwave background   on march  astronomers of the collaboration announced the apparent detection of -mode polarization of the cmb considered to be evidence of primordial gravitational waves that are predicted by the theory of inflation to occur during the earliest phase of the big bang      however later that year the planck collaboration provided a more accurate measurement of cosmic dust  concluding that the b-mode signal from dust is the same strength as that reported from    on january  a joint analysis of and planck data was published and the european space agency announced that the signal can be entirely attributed to interstellar dust in the milky way  edit large-scale structure of the cosmos structure formation galaxy formation and evolution understanding the formation and evolution of the largest and earliest structures ie quasars  galaxies  clusters and superclusters  is one of the largest efforts in cosmology cosmologists study a model of hierarchical structure formation in which structures form from the bottom up with smaller objects forming first while the largest objects such as superclusters are still assembling  one way to study structure in the universe is to survey the visible galaxies in order to construct a three-dimensional picture of the galaxies in the universe and measure the matter power spectrum  this is the approach of the sloan digital sky survey and the galaxy redshift survey    another tool for understanding structure formation is simulations which cosmologists use to study the gravitational aggregation of matter in the universe as it clusters into filaments  superclusters and voids  most simulations contain only non-baryonic cold dark matter  which should suffice to understand the universe on the largest scales as there is much more dark matter in the universe than visible baryonic matter more advanced simulations are starting to include baryons and study the formation of individual galaxies cosmologists study these simulations to see if they agree with the galaxy surveys and to understand any discrepancy  other complementary observations to measure the distribution of matter in the distant universe and to probe reionization include lyman-alpha forest  absorption  weak lensing gravitational lensing  these will help cosmologists settle the question of when and how structure formed in the universe edit dark matter evidence from big bang nucleosynthesis  the cosmic microwave background  structure formation and galaxy rotation curves suggests that about  of the mass of the universe consists of non-baryonic dark matter whereas only  consists of visible baryonic matter  the gravitational effects of dark matter are well understood as it behaves like a cold non-radiative fluid that forms haloes around galaxies dark matter has never been detected in the laboratory and the particle physics nature of dark matter remains completely unknown without observational constraints there are a number of candidates such as a stable supersymmetric particle a weakly interacting massive particle  a gravitationally-interacting massive particle  an axion  and a massive compact halo object  alternatives to the dark matter hypothesis include a modification of gravity at small accelerations  mond  or an effect from brane cosmology   edit dark energy if the universe is flat  there must be an additional component making up  in addition to the  dark matter and  baryons of the energy density of the universe this is called dark energy in order not to interfere with big bang nucleosynthesis and the cosmic microwave background it must not cluster in haloes like baryons and dark matter there is strong observational evidence for dark energy as the total energy density of the universe is known through constraints on the flatness of the universe but the amount of clustering matter is tightly measured and is much less than this the case for dark energy was strengthened in  when measurements demonstrated that the expansion of the universe has begun to gradually accelerate  apart from its density and its clustering properties nothing is known about dark energy quantum field theory predicts a cosmological constant cc much like dark energy but orders of magnitude larger than that observed  steven weinberg and a number of string theorists string landscape have invoked the anthropic principle  ie the reason that physicists observe a universe with such a small cosmological constant is that no physicists or any life could exist in a universe with a larger cosmological constant many cosmologists find this an unsatisfying explanation perhaps because while the weak anthropic principle is self-evident given that living observers exist there must be at least one universe with a cosmological constant which allows for life to exist it does not attempt to explain the context of that universe  for example the weak anthropic principle alone does not distinguish between other possible explanations for dark energy include quintessence  or a modification of gravity on the largest scales  the effect on cosmology of the dark energy that these models describe is given by the dark energy equation of state  which varies depending upon the theory the nature of dark energy is one of the most challenging problems in cosmology a better understanding of dark energy is likely to solve the problem of the ultimate fate of the universe  in the current cosmological epoch the accelerated expansion due to dark energy is preventing structures larger than superclusters from forming it is not known whether the acceleration will continue indefinitely perhaps even increasing until a big rip  or whether it will eventually reverse lead to a big freeze  or follow some other scenario  edit gravitational waves are ripples in the curvature of spacetime that propagate as waves at the speed of light generated in certain gravitational interactions that propagate outward from their source gravitational-wave astronomy is an emerging branch of observational astronomy which aims to use gravitational waves to collect observational data about sources of detectable gravitational waves such as binary star systems composed of white dwarfs  neutron stars  and black holes  and events such as supernovae  and the formation of the early universe shortly after the big bang   in  the ligo scientific collaboration and virgo collaboration teams announced that they had made the first observation of gravitational waves  originating from a pair of merging black holes using the advanced ligo detectors    on june  a second detection of gravitational waves from coalescing black holes was announced  besides ligo many other

giants sun true color a planet is an astronomical body orbiting a star or stellar remnant that is massive enough to be rounded by its own gravity  is not massive enough to cause thermonuclear fusion  and according to the international astronomical union but not all planetary scientists has cleared its neighbouring region of planetesimals  b   the term is ancient with ties to history  astrology  science  mythology  and religion  apart from earth itself five planets in the solar system are often visible to the naked eye  these were regarded by many early cultures as divine or as emissaries of deities  as scientific knowledge advanced human perception of the planets changed incorporating a number of disparate objects in  the international astronomical union iau officially adopted a resolution defining planets within the solar system this definition is controversial because it excludes many objects of planetary mass based on where or what they orbit although eight of the planetary bodies discovered before remain planets under the current definition some celestial bodies such as ceres  pallas  juno and vesta each an object in the solar asteroid belt and pluto the first trans-neptunian object discovered that were once considered by the scientific community are no longer viewed as planets under the current definition of  the planets were thought by ptolemy to orbit earth in deferent and epicycle motions although the idea that the planets orbited the sun had been suggested many times it was not until the century that this view was supported by evidence from the first telescopic astronomical observations  performed by galileo galilei  about the same time by careful analysis of pre-telescopic observational data collected by tycho brahe  johannes kepler found the planets orbits were elliptical rather than circular  as observational tools improved astronomers saw that like earth each of the planets rotated around an axis tilted with respect to its orbital pole  and some shared such features as ice caps and seasons  since the dawn of the space age  close observation by space probes has found that earth and the other planets share characteristics such as volcanism  hurricanes  tectonics  and even hydrology  planets in the solar system are divided into two main types large low-density giant planets  and smaller rocky terrestrials  there are eight planets in the solar system according to the iau definition  in order of increasing distance from the sun  they are the four terrestrials mercury  venus  earth and mars  then the four giant planets jupiter  saturn  uranus  and neptune  six of the planets are orbited by one or more natural satellites  the two exceptions being mercury and venus several thousands of planets around other stars  extrasolar planets  or exoplanets have been discovered in the milky way  as of july   known extrasolar planets in  planetary systems including multiple planetary systems  ranging in size from just above the size of the moon to gas giants about twice as large as jupiter  have been discovered out of which more than planets are the same size as earth  nine of which are at the same relative distance from their star as earth from the sun ie in the circumstellar habitable zone    on december  the kepler space telescope team reported the discovery of the first earth-sized extrasolar planets kepler-  and kepler-   orbiting a sun-like star  kepler-     a study analyzing gravitational microlensing data estimates an average of at least  bound planets for every star in the milky way  around one in five sun-like c stars is thought to have an earth-sized d planet in its habitable e zone   contents history of astronomy definition of planet timeline of solar system astronomy the idea of planets has evolved over its history from the divine lights of antiquity to the earthly objects of the scientific age the concept has expanded to include worlds not only in the solar system but in hundreds of other extrasolar systems the ambiguities inherent in defining planets have led to much scientific controversy the five classical planets of the solar system  being visible to the naked eye have been known since ancient times and have had a significant impact on mythology  religious cosmology  and ancient astronomy  in ancient times astronomers noted how certain lights moved across the sky as opposed to the  fixed stars  which maintained a constant relative position in the sky  ancient greeks called these lights   wandering stars or simply   wanderers  from which today word planet was derived    in ancient greece  china  babylon  and indeed all pre-modern civilizations   it was almost universally believed that earth was the center of the universe and that all the planets circled earth the reasons for this perception were that stars and planets appeared to revolve around earth each day  and the apparently common-sense perceptions that earth was solid and stable and that it was not moving but at rest babylonian astronomy the first civilization known to have a functional theory of the planets were the babylonians  who lived in mesopotamia in the first and second millennia bc the oldest surviving planetary astronomical text is the babylonian venus tablet of ammisaduqa  a -century bc copy of a list of observations of the motions of the planet venus that probably dates as early as the second millennium bc  the mulapin is a pair of cuneiform tablets dating from the century bc that lays out the motions of the sun moon and planets over the course of the year  the babylonian astrologers also laid the foundations of what would eventually become western astrology   the enuma anu enlil  written during the neo-assyrian period in the century bc  comprises a list of omens and their relationships with various celestial phenomena including the motions of the planets   venus  mercury  and the outer planets mars  jupiter  and saturn were all identified by babylonian astronomers  these would remain the only known planets until the invention of the telescope in early modern times  greek astronomy the ancient greeks initially did not attach as much significance to the planets as the babylonians the pythagoreans  in the and centuries bc appear to have developed their own independent planetary theory which consisted of the earth sun moon and planets revolving around a central fire at the center of the universe pythagoras or parmenides is said to have been the first to identify the evening star  hesperos  and morning star  phosphoros  as one and the same  aphrodite  greek corresponding to latin venus   though this had long been known by the babylonians in the century bc aristarchus of samos proposed a heliocentric system according to which earth and the planets revolved around the sun the geocentric system remained dominant until the scientific revolution  by the century bc during the hellenistic period  the greeks had begun to develop their own mathematical schemes for predicting the positions of the planets these schemes which were based on geometry rather than the arithmetic of the babylonians would eventually eclipse the babylonians theories in complexity and comprehensiveness and account for most of the astronomical movements observed from earth with the naked eye these theories would reach their fullest expression in the almagest written by ptolemy in the century ce so complete was the domination of ptolemy model that it superseded all previous works on astronomy and remained the definitive astronomical text in the western world for centuries   to the greeks and romans there were seven known planets each presumed to be circling earth according to the complex laws laid out by ptolemy they were in increasing order from earth in ptolemy order and using modern names the moon mercury venus the sun mars jupiter and saturn    cicero  in his de natura deorum  enumerated the planets known during the century bce using the names for them in use at the time  phainon phaethon pyroeis stilbon phosphoros lucifer hesperos indian astronomy hindu cosmology in ce the indian astronomer aryabhata propounded a planetary model that explicitly incorporated earth rotation about its axis which he explains as the cause of what appears to be an apparent westward motion of the stars he also believed that the orbits of planets are elliptical   aryabhata followers were particularly strong in south india  where his principles of the diurnal rotation of earth among others were followed and a number of secondary works were based on them  in  nilakantha somayaji of the kerala school of astronomy and mathematics  in his tantrasangraha  revised aryabhata model  in his  a commentary on aryabhata  he developed a planetary model where mercury venus mars jupiter and saturn orbit the sun which in turn orbits earth similar to the tychonic system later proposed by tycho brahe in the late century most astronomers of the kerala school who followed him accepted his planetary model   astronomy in the medieval islamic world cosmology in medieval islam in the century the transit of venus was observed by avicenna  who established that venus was at least sometimes below the sun  in the century ibn bajjah observed two planets as black spots on the face of the sun which was later identified as a transit of mercury and venus by the maragha astronomer qotb al-din shirazi in the century  ibn bajjah could not have observed a transit of venus because none occurred in his lifetime  heliocentrism with the advent of the scientific revolution  use of the term planet changed from something that moved across the sky in relation to the star field  to a body that orbited earth or that was believed to do so at the time and by the century to something that directly orbited the sun when the heliocentric model of copernicus  galileo and kepler gained sway thus earth became included in the list of planets  whereas the sun and moon were excluded at first when the first satellites of jupiter and saturn were discovered in the century the terms planet and satellite were used interchangeably although the latter would gradually become more prevalent in the following century  until the mid- century the number of planets rose rapidly because any newly discovered object directly orbiting the sun was listed as a planet by the scientific community in the century astronomers began to realize that recently discovered bodies that had been classified as planets for almost half a century such as ceres  pallas  juno  and vesta  were very different from the traditional ones these bodies shared the same region of space between mars and jupiter the asteroid belt  and had a much smaller mass as a result they were reclassified as  asteroids  in the absence of any formal definition a planet came to be understood as any large body that orbited the sun because there was a dramatic size gap between the asteroids and the planets and the spate of new discoveries seemed to have ended after the discovery of neptune in  there was no apparent need to have a formal definition  in the century pluto was discovered after initial observations led to the belief that it was larger than earth  the object was immediately accepted as the ninth planet further monitoring found the body was actually much smaller in  ray lyttleton suggested that pluto may be an escaped satellite of neptune   and fred whipple suggested in that pluto may be a comet  as it was still larger than all known asteroids and the population of dwarf planets  other trans-neptunian objects was not well observed  it kept its status until  in  astronomers aleksander wolszczan and dale frail announced the discovery of planets around a pulsar  psr    this discovery is generally considered to be the first definitive detection of a planetary system around another star then on october   michel mayor and didier queloz of the geneva observatory announced the first definitive detection of an exoplanet orbiting an ordinary main-sequence star  pegasi   the discovery of extrasolar planets led to another ambiguity in defining a planet the point at which a planet becomes a star many known extrasolar planets are many times the mass of jupiter approaching that of stellar objects known as brown dwarfs  brown dwarfs are generally considered stars due to their ability to fuse deuterium  a heavier isotope of hydrogen  although objects more massive than times that of jupiter fuse hydrogen objects of only jupiter masses can fuse deuterium deuterium is quite rare and most brown dwarfs would have ceased fusing deuterium long before their discovery making them effectively indistinguishable from supermassive planets  with the discovery during the latter half of the century of more objects within the solar system and large objects around other stars disputes arose over what should constitute a planet there were particular disagreements over whether an object should be considered a planet if it was part of a distinct population such as a belt  or if it was large enough to generate energy by the thermonuclear fusion of deuterium  a growing number of astronomers argued for pluto to be declassified as a planet because many similar objects approaching its size had been found in the same region of the solar system the kuiper belt  during the and early  pluto was found to be just one small body in a population of thousands some of them such as quaoar  sedna  and eris  were heralded in the popular press as the tenth planet  failing to receive widespread scientific recognition the announcement of eris in  an object then thought of as  more massive than pluto created the necessity and public desire for an official definition of a planet acknowledging the problem the iau set about creating the definition of planet  and produced one in august  the number of planets dropped to the eight significantly larger bodies that had cleared their orbit mercury venus earth mars jupiter saturn uranus and neptune and a new class of dwarf planets was created initially containing three objects  ceres  pluto and eris  there is no official definition of extrasolar planets  in  the international astronomical union iau working group on extrasolar planets issued a position statement but this position statement was never proposed as an official iau resolution and was never voted on by iau members the positions statement incorporates the following guidelines mostly focused upon the boundary between planets and brown dwarfs  true masses isotopic abundance  brown dwarfs star clusters this working definition was amended by the iau commission  exoplanets and the solar system in august   the official working definition of an is now as follows  instability the iau noted that this definition could be expected to evolve as knowledge improves one definition of a sub-brown dwarf is a planet-mass object that formed through cloud collapse rather than accretion  this formation distinction between a sub-brown dwarf and a planet is not universally agreed upon astronomers are divided into two camps as whether to consider the formation process of a planet as part of its division in classification  one reason for the dissent is that often it may not be possible to determine the formation process for example a planet formed by accretion around a star may get ejected from the system to become free-floating and likewise a sub-brown dwarf that formed on its own in a star cluster through cloud collapse may get captured into orbit around a star one study suggests that objects above formed through gravitational instability and should not be thought of as planets  the jupiter-mass cutoff represents an average mass rather than a precise threshold value large objects will fuse most of their deuterium and smaller ones will fuse only a little and the value is somewhere in between in fact calculations show that an object fuses  of its initial deuterium content when the total mass ranges between and   the amount of deuterium fused depends not only on mass but also on the composition of the object on the amount of helium and deuterium present  as of the extrasolar planets encyclopaedia included objects up to jupiter masses saying the fact that there is no special feature around in the observed mass spectrum reinforces the choice to forget this mass limit  as of this limit was increased to jupiter masses  based on a study of massdensity relationships  the exoplanet data explorer includes objects up to jupiter masses with the advisory the jupiter-mass distinction by the iau working group is physically unmotivated for planets with rocky cores and observationally problematic due to the sin i ambiguity  the nasa exoplanet archive includes objects with a mass or minimum mass equal to or less than jupiter masses  another criterion for separating planets and brown dwarfs rather than deuterium fusion formation process or location is whether the core pressure is dominated by coulomb pressure or electron degeneracy pressure    euler diagram iau definition of planet the matter of the lower limit was addressed during the meeting of the iau general assembly  after much debate and one failed proposal a large majority of those remaining at the meeting voted to pass a resolution the resolution defines planets within the solar system as follows  hydrostatic equilibrium cleared the neighbourhood under this definition the solar system is considered to have eight planets bodies that fulfill the first two conditions but not the third such as ceres pluto and eris are classified as dwarf planets  provided they are not also natural satellites of other planets originally an iau committee had proposed a definition that would have included a much larger number of planets as it did not include c as a criterion  after much discussion it was decided via a vote that those bodies should instead be classified as dwarf planets   this definition is based in theories of planetary formation in which planetary embryos initially clear their orbital neighborhood of other smaller objects as described by astronomer steven soter   the iau definition presents some challenges for exoplanets because the language is specific to the solar system and because the criteria of roundness and orbital zone clearance are not presently observable astronomer jean-luc margot proposed a mathematical criterion that determines whether an object can clear its orbit during the lifetime of its host star based on the mass of the planet its semimajor axis and the mass of its host star   the formula produces a value f called that is greater than for planets the eight known planets and all known exoplanets have values above  while ceres pluto and eris have values of  or less objects with values of or more are also expected to be approximately spherical so that objects that fulfill the orbital zone clearance requirement automatically fulfill the roundness requirement  list of former planets the table below lists solar system bodies once considered to be planets but no longer considered as such by the iau as well as whether they would be considered planets under alternative definitions such as soter definition  that favors dynamical dominance or stern  and definitions

minor planet semi-major axis neptune the reporting of newly discovered large kuiper belt objects as planets particularly eris triggered the iau decision on what a planet is weekday names naked-eye planet olympus solar system the names for the planets in the western world are derived from the naming practices of the romans which ultimately derive from those of the greeks and the babylonians in ancient greece  the two great luminaries the sun and the moon were called helios and selene  two ancient titanic deities the slowest planet saturn was called phainon  the shiner followed by phaethon jupiter bright the red planet mars was known as pyroeis  the fiery the brightest venus was known as phosphoros  the light bringer and the fleeting final planet mercury was called stilbon  the gleamer the greeks also assigned each planet to one among their pantheon of gods the olympians and the earlier titans  helios selene titans olympians apollo artemis cronus titan zeus ares aphrodite hermes  the greek practice of grafting their gods names onto the planets was almost certainly borrowed from the babylonians the babylonians named phosphoros venus after their goddess of love ishtar  pyroeis mars after their god of war nergal  stilbon saturn after their god of wisdom nabu  and phaethon jupiter after their chief god marduk   there are too many concordances between greek and babylonian naming conventions for them to have arisen separately  the translation was not perfect for instance the babylonian nergal was a god of war and thus the greeks identified him with ares unlike ares nergal was also god of pestilence and the underworld  today most people in the western world know the planets by names derived from the olympian pantheon of gods although modern greeks still use their ancient names for the planets other european languages because of the influence of the roman empire and later the catholic church  use the roman latin names rather than the greek ones the romans who like the greeks were indo-europeans  shared with them a common pantheon under different names but lacked the rich narrative traditions that greek poetic culture had given their gods  during the later period of the roman republic  roman writers borrowed much of the greek narratives and applied them to their own pantheon to the point where they became virtually indistinguishable  when the romans studied greek astronomy they gave the planets their own gods names mercurius for hermes venus aphrodite mars ares iuppiter zeus and saturnus cronus when subsequent planets were discovered in the and centuries the naming practice was retained with neptnus  poseidon  uranus is unique in that it is named for a greek deity rather than his roman counterpart  some romans  following a belief possibly originating in mesopotamia but developed in hellenistic egypt  believed that the seven gods after whom the planets were named took hourly shifts in looking after affairs on earth the order of shifts went saturn jupiter mars sun venus mercury moon from the farthest to the closest planet  therefore the first day was started by saturn  hour second day by sun  hour followed by moon  hour mars mercury jupiter and venus because each day was named by the god that started it this is also the order of the days of the week in the roman calendar after the nundinal cycle was rejected and still preserved in many modern languages  in english   and are straightforward translations of these roman names the other days were renamed after tw tuesday wden wednesday unor thursday and fr friday the anglo-saxon gods considered similar or equivalent to mars mercury jupiter and venus respectively earth is the only planet whose name in english is not derived from greco-roman mythology because it was only generally accepted as a planet in the   there is no tradition of naming it after a god the same is true in english at least of the sun and the moon though they are no longer generally considered planets the name originates from the old english word  which was the word for ground and dirt as well as the earth itself  as with its equivalents in the other germanic languages  it derives ultimately from the proto-germanic word  as can be seen in the english  the german  the dutch  and the scandinavian  many of the romance languages retain the old roman word terra or some variation of it that was used with the meaning of dry land as opposed to sea  the non-romance languages use their own native words the greeks retain their original name  non-european cultures use other planetary-naming systems india uses a system based on the navagraha  which incorporates the seven traditional planets  surya for the sun chandra for the moon budha for mercury shukra for venus mangala for mars for jupiter and shani for saturn and the ascending and descending lunar nodes rahu and  china and the countries of eastern asia historically subject to chinese cultural influence such as japan korea and vietnam  use a naming system based on the five chinese elements  water mercury metal venus fire mars wood jupiter and earth saturn  in traditional hebrew astronomy  the seven traditional planets have for the most part descriptive names the sun is or the hot one the moon is or the white one venus is or the bright planet mercury is or the planet given its lack of distinguishing features mars is or the red one and saturn is or the resting one in reference to its slow movement compared to the other visible planets  the odd one out is jupiter called or justice steiglitz suggests that this may be a euphemism for the original name of or  baal planet seen as idolatrous and euphemized in a similar manner to ishbosheth from ii samuel   in arabic mercury is   cognate with ishtar  astarte  venus is   the bright one  an epithet of the goddess al-   earth is   from the same root as eretz  mars is   meaning featherless arrow due to its retrograde motion   jupiter is   the reliable one from akkadian   and saturn is   withdrawer     nebular hypothesis it is not known with certainty how planets are formed the prevailing theory is that they are formed during the collapse of a nebula into a thin disk of gas and dust a protostar forms at the core surrounded by a rotating protoplanetary disk  through accretion a process of sticky collision dust particles in the disk steadily accumulate mass to form ever-larger bodies local concentrations of mass known as planetesimals form and these accelerate the accretion process by drawing in additional material by their gravitational attraction these concentrations become ever denser until they collapse inward under gravity to form protoplanets   after a planet reaches a mass somewhat larger than mars  mass it begins to accumulate an extended atmosphere  greatly increasing the capture rate of the planetesimals by means of atmospheric drag    depending on the accretion history of solids and gas a giant planet  an ice giant  or a terrestrial planet may result    when the protostar has grown such that it ignites to form a star  the surviving disk is removed from the inside outward by photoevaporation  the solar wind  poyntingrobertson drag and other effects   thereafter there still may be many protoplanets orbiting the star or each other but over time many will collide either to form a single larger planet or release material for other larger protoplanets or planets to absorb  those objects that have become massive enough will capture most matter in their orbital neighbourhoods to become planets protoplanets that have avoided collisions may become natural satellites of planets through a process of gravitational capture or remain in belts of other objects to become either dwarf planets or small bodies  the energetic impacts of the smaller planetesimals as well as radioactive decay  will heat up the growing planet causing it to at least partially melt the interior of the planet begins to differentiate by mass developing a denser core  smaller terrestrial planets lose most of their atmospheres because of this accretion but the lost gases can be replaced by outgassing from the mantle and from the subsequent impact of comets   smaller planets will lose any atmosphere they gain through various escape mechanisms  with the discovery and observation of planetary systems around stars other than the sun it is becoming possible to elaborate revise or even replace this account the level of metallicity an astronomical term describing the abundance of chemical elements with an atomic number greater than  helium is now thought to determine the likelihood that a star will have planets  hence it is thought that a metal-rich population i star will likely have a more substantial planetary system than a metal-poor population ii star  supernova remnant sun solar system inner planets mercury venus earth mars giant planets jupiter saturn uranus

more than one planet      in early  radio astronomers aleksander wolszczan and dale frail announced the discovery of two planets orbiting the pulsar psr    this discovery was confirmed and is generally considered to be the first definitive detection of exoplanets these pulsar planets are believed to have formed from the unusual remnants of the supernova that produced the pulsar in a second round of planet formation or else to be the remaining rocky cores of giant planets that survived the supernova and then decayed into their current orbits update the first confirmed discovery of an extrasolar planet orbiting an ordinary main-sequence star occurred on october  when michel mayor and didier queloz of the university of geneva announced the detection of an exoplanet around pegasi  from then until the kepler mission most known extrasolar planets were gas giants comparable in mass to jupiter or larger as they were more easily detected the catalog of kepler candidate planets consists mostly of planets the size of neptune and smaller down to smaller than mercury there are types of planets that do not exist in the solar system super-earths and mini-neptunes  which could be rocky like earth or a mixture of volatiles and gas like neptunea radius of  times that of earth is a possible dividing line between the two types of planet  there are hot jupiters that orbit very close to their star and may evaporate to become chthonian planets  which are the leftover cores another possible type of planet is carbon planets  which form in systems with a higher proportion of carbon than in the solar system a study analyzing gravitational microlensing data estimates an average of at least  bound planets for every star in the milky way  on december  the kepler space telescope team reported the discovery of the first earth-size exoplanets  kepler-  and kepler-   orbiting a sun-like star  kepler-     around in sun-like stars have an earth-sized d planet in the habitable e zone so the nearest would be expected to be within light-years distance from earth   the frequency of occurrence of such terrestrial planets is one of the variables in the drake equation  which estimates the number of intelligent communicating civilizations that exist in the milky way   there are exoplanets that are much closer to their parent star than any planet in the solar system is to the sun and there are also exoplanets that are much farther from their star mercury  the closest planet to the sun at  au  takes days for an orbit but the shortest known orbits for exoplanets take only a few hours see ultra-short period planet  the kepler- system has five of its planets in shorter orbits than mercury all of them much more massive than mercury neptune is au from the sun and takes years to orbit but there are exoplanets that are hundreds of au from their star and take more than a thousand years to orbit eg b  geophysical definition of  list of gravitationally rounded objects of the solar system a planetary-mass object  pmo  planemo   or planetary body is a celestial object with a mass that falls within the range of the definition of a planet massive enough to achieve hydrostatic equilibrium to be rounded under its own gravity but not enough to sustain core fusion like a star   by definition all planets are  but the purpose of this term is to refer to objects that do not conform to typical expectations for a planet these include dwarf planets  which are rounded by their own gravity but not massive enough to clear their own orbit  planetary-mass moons  and free-floating planemos which may have been ejected from a system  rogue planets  or formed through cloud-collapse rather than accretion sometimes called sub-brown dwarfs  dwarf planet pluto dwarf planet a dwarf planet is a planetary-mass object that is neither a true planet nor a natural satellite it is in direct orbit of a star and is massive enough for its gravity to compress it into a hydrostatically equilibrious shape usually a spheroid but has not cleared the neighborhood of other material around its orbit planetary scientist and new horizons principal investigator alan stern  who proposed the term planet has argued that location should not matter and that only geophysical attributes should be taken into account and that dwarf planets are thus a subtype of planet the iau accepted the term rather than the more neutral  but decided to classify dwarf planets as a separate category of object  rogue planet five-planet nice model several computer simulations of stellar and planetary system formation have suggested that some objects of planetary mass would be ejected into interstellar space   such objects are typically called   sub-brown dwarf stars form via the gravitational collapse of gas clouds but smaller objects can also form via cloud-collapse planetary-mass objects formed this way are sometimes called sub-brown dwarfs sub-brown dwarfs may be free-floating such as cha -  and ots   or orbiting a larger object such as   binary systems of sub-brown dwarfs are theoretically possible oph - was initially thought to be a binary system of a brown dwarf of jupiter masses and a sub-brown dwarf of jupiter masses but further observations revised the estimated masses upwards to greater than jupiter masses making them brown dwarfs according to the iau working definitions    in close binary star systems one of the stars can lose mass to a heavier companion accretion-powered pulsars may drive mass loss the shrinking star can then become a planetary-mass object  an example is a jupiter-mass object orbiting the pulsar psr -   these shrunken white dwarfs may become a helium planet or carbon planet  satellite planet some large satellites moons are of similar size or larger than the planet mercury  eg jupiter galilean moons and titan  proponents of the geophysical definition of planets argue that location should not matter and that only geophysical attributes should be taken into account in the definition of a planet alan stern proposes the term for a planet-sized satellite  rogue planets in stellar clusters have similar velocities to the stars and so can be recaptured they are typically captured into wide orbits between and au the capture efficiency decreases with increasing cluster volume and for a given cluster size it increases with the hostprimary mass it is almost independent of the planetary mass single and multiple planets could be captured into arbitrary unaligned orbits non-coplanar with each other or with the stellar host spin or pre-existing planetary system  although each planet has unique physical characteristics a number of broad commonalities do exist among them some of these characteristics such as rings or natural satellites have only as yet been observed in planets in the solar system whereas others are also commonly observed in extrasolar planets orbit orbital elements kepler laws of planetary motion exoplanetology orbital parameters pluto eccentricity inclination according to current definitions all planets must revolve around stars thus any potential  rogue planets  are excluded in the solar system all the planets orbit the sun in the same direction as the sun rotates counter-clockwise as seen from above the sun north pole at least one extrasolar planet wasp-  has been found to orbit in the opposite direction to its star rotation  the period of one revolution of a planet orbit is known as its sidereal period or   a planet year depends on its distance from its star the farther a planet is from its star not only the longer the distance it must travel but also the slower its speed because it is less affected by its star gravity  no planet orbit is perfectly circular and hence the distance of each varies over the course of its year the closest approach to its star is called its periastron  perihelion in the solar system whereas its farthest separation from the star is called its apastron  aphelion  as a planet approaches periastron its speed increases as it trades gravitational potential energy for kinetic energy just as a falling object on earth accelerates as it falls as the planet reaches apastron its speed decreases just as an object thrown upwards on earth slows down as it reaches the apex of its trajectory  each planet orbit is delineated by a set of elements eccentricity    semi-major axis  inclination ecliptic  kuiper belt  ascending descending nodes  longitude of the ascending node argument of periapsis  axial tilt axial tilt planets also have varying degrees of axial tilt they lie at an angle to the plane of their stars equators  this causes the amount of light received by each hemisphere to vary over the course of its year when the northern hemisphere points away from its star the southern hemisphere points towards it and vice versa each planet therefore has seasons changes to the climate over the course of its year the time at which each hemisphere points farthest or nearest from its star is known as its solstice  each planet has two in the course of its orbit when one hemisphere has its summer solstice when its day is longest the other has its winter solstice when its day is shortest the varying amount of light and heat received by each hemisphere creates annual changes in weather patterns for each half of the planet jupiter axial tilt is very small so its seasonal variation is minimal uranus on the other hand has an axial tilt so extreme it is virtually on its side which means that its hemispheres are either perpetually in sunlight or perpetually in darkness around the time of its solstices  among extrasolar planets axial tilts are not known for certain though most hot jupiters are believed to have negligible to no axial tilt as a result of their proximity to their stars  exoplanetology rotation and axial tilt the planets rotate around invisible axes through their centres a planet rotation period is known as a stellar day  most of the planets in the solar system rotate in the same direction as they orbit the sun which is counter-clockwise as seen from above the sun north pole  the exceptions being venus  and uranus  which rotate clockwise though uranus extreme axial tilt means there are differing conventions on which of its poles is north and therefore whether it is rotating clockwise or anti-clockwise  regardless of which convention is used uranus has a retrograde rotation relative to its orbit the rotation of a planet can be induced by several factors during formation a net angular momentum can be induced by the individual angular momentum contributions of accreted objects the accretion of gas by the giant planets can also contribute to the angular momentum finally during the last stages of planet building a stochastic process of protoplanetary accretion can randomly alter the spin axis of the planet  there is great variation in the length of day between the planets with venus taking days to rotate and the giant planets only a few hours  the rotational periods of extrasolar planets are not known however for hot jupiters  their proximity to their stars means that they are tidally locked ie their orbits are in sync with their rotations this means they always show one face to their stars with one side in perpetual day the other in perpetual night  clearing the neighbourhood the defining dynamic characteristic of a planet is that it has  a planet that has cleared its neighborhood has accumulated enough mass to gather up or sweep away all the planetesimals in its orbit in effect it orbits its star in isolation as opposed to sharing its orbit with a multitude of similar-sized objects this characteristic was mandated as part of the iau official definition of a planet in august  this criterion excludes such planetary bodies as pluto  eris and ceres from full-fledged planethood making them instead dwarf planets   although to date this criterion only applies to the solar system a number of young extrasolar systems have been found in which evidence suggests orbital clearing is taking place within their circumstellar discs   earth size and shape astronomical body size planetary coordinate system needs expansion adding to it a planet size is defined at least by an average radius eg earth radius  jupiter radius  etc polar and equatorial radii of a spheroid or more general triaxial ellipsoidal shapes are often estimated eg reference ellipsoid 
derived quantities include the flattening surface area and volume
knowing further the rotation rate and mass allows the calculation of normal gravity  planetary mass a planet defining physical characteristic is that it is massive enough for the force of its own gravity to dominate over the electromagnetic forces binding its physical structure leading to a state of hydrostatic equilibrium  this effectively means that all planets are spherical or spheroidal up to a certain mass an object can be irregular in shape but beyond that point which varies depending on the chemical makeup of the object gravity begins to pull an object towards its own centre of mass until the object collapses into a sphere  mass is also the prime attribute by which planets are distinguished from stars  the upper mass limit for planethood is roughly times jupiter mass for objects with solar-type isotopic abundance  beyond which it achieves conditions suitable for nuclear fusion  other than the sun no objects of such mass exist in the solar system but there are exoplanets of this size the -jupiter-mass limit is not universally agreed upon and the extrasolar planets encyclopaedia includes objects up to jupiter masses  and the exoplanet data explorer up to jupiter masses  the smallest known planet is psr   one of the first extrasolar planets discovered which was found in in orbit around a pulsar  its mass is roughly half that of the planet mercury  the smallest known planet orbiting a main-sequence star other than the sun is kepler-  with a mass and radius slightly higher than that of the moon  planetary differentiation every planet began its existence in an entirely fluid state in early formation the denser heavier materials sank to the centre leaving the lighter materials near the surface each therefore has a differentiated interior consisting of a dense planetary core surrounded by a mantle that either is or was a fluid  the terrestrial planets are sealed within hard crusts   but in the giant planets the mantle simply blends into the upper cloud layers the terrestrial planets have cores of elements such as iron and nickel  and mantles of silicates  jupiter and saturn are believed to have cores of rock and metal surrounded by mantles of metallic hydrogen   uranus and neptune  which are smaller have rocky cores surrounded by mantles of water  ammonia  methane and other ices   the fluid action within these planets cores creates a geodynamo that generates a magnetic field   atmosphere extraterrestrial atmospheres extraterrestrial skies all of the solar system planets except mercury  have substantial atmospheres because their gravity is strong enough to keep gases close to the surface the larger giant planets are massive enough to keep large amounts of the light gases hydrogen and helium  whereas the smaller planets lose these gases into space   the composition of earth atmosphere is different from the other planets because the various life processes that have transpired on the planet have introduced free molecular oxygen   planetary atmospheres are affected by the varying insolation or internal energy leading to the formation of dynamic weather systems such as hurricanes  on earth planet-wide dust storms on mars a greater-than-earth-sized anticyclone on jupiter called the great red spot  and holes in the atmosphere on neptune  at least one extrasolar planet hd b  has been claimed to have such a weather system similar to the great red spot but twice as large  hot jupiters due to their extreme proximities to their host stars have been shown to be losing their atmospheres into space due to stellar radiation much like the tails of comets   these planets may have vast differences in temperature between their day and night sides that produce supersonic winds  although the day and night sides of hd b appear to have very similar temperatures indicating that that planet atmosphere effectively redistributes the star energy around the planet  magnetosphere earth magnetosphere one important characteristic of the planets is their intrinsic magnetic moments  which in turn give rise to magnetospheres the presence of a magnetic field indicates that the planet is still geologically alive in other words magnetized planets have flows of electrically conducting material in their interiors which generate their magnetic fields these fields significantly change the interaction of the planet and solar wind a magnetized planet creates a cavity in the solar wind around itself called the magnetosphere which the wind cannot penetrate the magnetosphere can be much larger than the planet itself in contrast non-magnetized planets have only small magnetospheres induced by interaction of the ionosphere with the solar wind which cannot effectively protect the planet  of the eight planets in the solar system only venus and mars lack such a magnetic field  in addition the moon of jupiter ganymede also has one of the magnetized planets the magnetic field of mercury is the weakest and is barely able to deflect the solar wind  ganymede magnetic field is several times larger and jupiter is the strongest in the solar system so strong in fact that it poses a serious health risk to future manned missions to its moons the magnetic fields of the other giant planets are roughly similar in strength to that of earth but their magnetic moments are significantly larger the magnetic fields of uranus and neptune are strongly tilted relative the rotational axis and displaced from the centre of the planet  in  a team of astronomers in hawaii observed an extrasolar planet around the star hd  which appeared to be creating a sunspot on the surface of its parent star the team hypothesized that the planet magnetosphere was transferring energy onto the star surface increasing its already high  temperature by an additional   natural satellite planetary ring rings of saturn several planets or dwarf planets in the solar system such as neptune and pluto have orbital periods that are in resonance with each other or with smaller bodies this is also common in satellite systems all except mercury and venus have natural satellites  often called moons earth has one mars has two and the giant planets have numerous moons in complex planetary-type systems many moons of the giant planets have features similar to those on the terrestrial planets and dwarf planets and some have been studied as possible abodes of life especially europa     the four giant planets are also orbited by planetary rings of varying size and complexity the rings are composed primarily of dust or particulate matter but can host tiny  moonlets  whose gravity shapes and maintains their structure although the origins of planetary rings is not precisely known they are believed to be the result of natural satellites that fell below their parent planet roche limit and were torn apart by tidal forces    no secondary characteristics have been observed around extrasolar planets the sub-brown dwarf cha -  which has been described as a rogue planet  is believed to be orbited by a tiny protoplanetary disc  and the sub-brown dwarf ots was shown to be surrounded by a substantial protoplanetary disk

 to   to  star disambiguation star-forming large magellanic cloud false color sun g-type main-sequence star leo a star is an astronomical object consisting of a luminous spheroid of plasma held together by its own gravity  the nearest star to earth is the sun  many other stars are visible to the naked eye at night  but due to their immense distance from earth they appear as fixed points of light in the sky the most prominent stars are grouped into constellations and asterisms  and many of the brightest stars have proper names astronomers have assembled star catalogues that identify the known stars and provide standardized stellar designations  the observable universe contains an estimated to stars but most are invisible to the naked eye from earth including all individual stars outside our galaxy  the milky way  a star life begins with the gravitational collapse of a gaseous nebula of material composed primarily of hydrogen along with helium and trace amounts of heavier elements the total mass of a star is the main factor that determines its evolution and eventual fate for most of its active life  a star shines due to thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium in its core releasing energy that traverses the star interior and then radiates into outer space  at the end of a star lifetime its core becomes a stellar remnant  a white dwarf  a neutron star  or if it is sufficiently massive a black hole  almost all naturally occurring elements heavier than lithium are created by stellar nucleosynthesis in stars or their remnants chemically enriched material is returned to the interstellar medium by stellar mass loss or supernova explosions and then recycled into new stars astronomers can determine stellar properties including mass age metallicity chemical composition variability  distance  and motion through space by carrying out observations of a star apparent brightness  spectrum  and changes in its position on the sky over time stars can form orbital systems with other astronomical objects as in the case of planetary systems and star systems with two or more stars when two such stars have a relatively close orbit their gravitational interaction can have a significant impact on their evolution stars can form part of a much larger gravitationally bound structure such as a star cluster or a galaxy contents  leo johannes hevelius  historically stars have been important to civilizations throughout the world they have been part of religious practices used for celestial  and orientation to mark the passage of seasons and to define calendars early astronomers recognized a difference between  fixed stars  whose position on the celestial sphere does not change and wandering stars  planets  which move noticeably relative to the fixed stars over days or weeks  many ancient astronomers believed that the stars were permanently affixed to a heavenly sphere and that they were immutable by convention astronomers grouped prominent stars into asterisms and constellations and used them to track the motions of the planets and the inferred position of the sun  the motion of the sun against the background stars and the horizon was used to create calendars  which could be used to regulate agricultural practices  the gregorian calendar  currently used nearly everywhere in the world is a solar calendar based on the angle of the earth rotational axis relative to its local star the sun the oldest accurately dated star chart was the result of ancient egyptian astronomy in bc  the earliest known star catalogues were compiled by the ancient babylonian astronomers of mesopotamia in the late millennium bc during the kassite period c bc  the first star catalogue in greek astronomy was created by aristillus in approximately bc with the help of timocharis   the star catalog of hipparchus  century bc included stars and was used to assemble ptolemy star catalogue  hipparchus is known for the discovery of the first recorded nova new star  many of the constellations and star names in use today derive from greek astronomy in spite of the apparent immutability of the heavens chinese astronomers were aware that new stars could appear  in ad they were the first to observe and write about a supernova  now known as the sn   the brightest stellar event in recorded history was the sn supernova which was observed in and written about by the egyptian astronomer ali ibn ridwan and several chinese astronomers  the sn supernova which gave birth to the crab nebula  was also observed by chinese and islamic astronomers    medieval islamic astronomers gave arabic names to many stars that are still used today and they invented numerous astronomical instruments that could compute the positions of the stars they built the first large observatory re institutes mainly for the purpose of producing zij star catalogues  among these the book of fixed stars  was written by the persian astronomer abd al-rahman al-sufi  who observed a number of stars star clusters including the omicron velorum and brocchi clusters  and galaxies including the andromeda galaxy   according to a zahoor in the century the persian polymath scholar abu rayhan biruni described the milky way galaxy as a multitude of fragments having the properties of nebulous stars and gave the latitudes of various stars during a lunar eclipse in   according to josep puig the andalusian astronomer ibn bajjah proposed that the milky way was made up of many stars that almost touched one another and appeared to be a continuous image due to the effect of refraction from sublunary material citing his observation of the conjunction of jupiter and mars on ah  ad as evidence  early european astronomers such as tycho brahe identified new stars in the night sky later termed  suggesting that the heavens were not immutable in  giordano bruno suggested that the stars were like the sun and may have other planets  possibly even earth-like in orbit around them  an idea that had been suggested earlier by the ancient greek philosophers  democritus and epicurus   and by medieval islamic cosmologists  such as fakhr al-din al-razi   by the following century the idea of the stars being the same as the sun was reaching a consensus among astronomers to explain why these stars exerted no net gravitational pull on the solar system isaac newton suggested that the stars were equally distributed in every direction an idea prompted by the theologian richard bentley   the italian astronomer geminiano montanari recorded observing variations in luminosity of the star algol in  edmond halley published the first measurements of the proper motion of a pair of nearby fixed stars demonstrating that they had changed positions since the time of the ancient greek astronomers ptolemy and hipparchus  william herschel was the first astronomer to attempt to determine the distribution of stars in the sky during the  he established a series of gauges in directions and counted the stars observed along each line of sight from this he deduced that the number of stars steadily increased toward one side of the sky in the direction of the milky way core  his son john herschel repeated this study in the southern hemisphere and found a corresponding increase in the same direction  in addition to his other accomplishments william herschel is noted for his discovery that some stars do not merely lie along the same line of sight but are physical companions that form binary star systems  the science of stellar spectroscopy was pioneered by joseph von fraunhofer and angelo secchi  by comparing the spectra of stars such as sirius to the sun they found differences in the strength and number of their absorption lines the dark lines in stellar spectra caused by the atmosphere absorption of specific frequencies in  secchi began classifying stars into spectral types   the modern version of the stellar classification scheme was developed by annie j cannon during the early   the first direct measurement of the distance to a star  cygni at  light-years  was made in by friedrich bessel using the parallax technique parallax measurements demonstrated the vast separation of the stars in the heavens  observation of double stars gained increasing importance during the century in  friedrich bessel observed changes in the proper motion of the star sirius and inferred a hidden companion edward pickering discovered the first spectroscopic binary in when he observed the periodic splitting of the spectral lines of the star mizar in a -day period detailed observations of many binary star systems were collected by astronomers such as friedrich georg wilhelm von struve and s w burnham  allowing the masses of stars to be determined from computation of orbital elements  the first solution to the problem of deriving an orbit of binary stars from telescope observations was made by felix savary in   the twentieth century saw increasingly rapid advances in the scientific study of stars the photograph became a valuable astronomical tool karl schwarzschild discovered that the color of a star and hence its temperature could be determined by comparing the visual magnitude against the photographic magnitude  the development of the photoelectric photometer allowed precise measurements of magnitude at multiple wavelength intervals in albert a michelson made the first measurements of a stellar diameter using an interferometer on the hooker telescope at mount wilson observatory   important theoretical work on the physical structure of stars occurred during the first decades of the twentieth century in  the hertzsprung-russell diagram was developed propelling the astrophysical study of stars successful models were developed to explain the interiors of stars and stellar evolution cecilia payne-gaposchkin first proposed that stars were made primarily of hydrogen and helium in her phd thesis  the spectra of stars were further understood through advances in quantum physics  this allowed the chemical composition of the stellar atmosphere to be determined  spitzer space telescope milky way with the exception of rare events such as supernovae and supernova imposters  individual stars have primarily been observed in the local group   and especially in the visible part of the milky way as demonstrated by the detailed star

galaxy and its satellites  individual stars such as cepheid variables have been observed in the  and galaxies of the virgo cluster   as well as luminous stars in some other relatively nearby galaxies  with the aid of gravitational lensing  a single star named icarus  has been observed at light-years away   stellar designation astronomical naming conventions star catalogue the concept of a constellation was known to exist during the babylonian period ancient sky watchers imagined that prominent arrangements of stars formed patterns and they associated these with particular aspects of nature or their myths twelve of these formations lay along the band of the ecliptic and these became the basis of astrology   many of the more prominent individual stars were given names particularly with arabic or latin designations as well as certain constellations and the sun itself individual stars have their own myths   to the ancient greeks  some stars known as planets greek plants meaning wanderer represented various important deities from which the names of the planets mercury  venus  mars  jupiter and saturn were taken   uranus and neptune were greek and roman gods  but neither planet was known in antiquity because of their low brightness their names were assigned by later astronomers circa  the names of the constellations were used to name the stars in the corresponding regions of the sky the german astronomer johann bayer created a series of star maps and applied greek letters as designations to the stars in each constellation later a numbering system based on the star right ascension was invented and added to john flamsteed star catalogue in his book the edition whereby this numbering system came to be called flamsteed designation or    the internationally recognized authority for naming celestial bodies is the international astronomical union iau  the international astronomical union maintains the working group on star names wgsn  which catalogs and standardizes proper names for stars  a number of private companies sell names of stars which are not recognized by the iau professional astronomers or the amateur astronomy community  the british library calls this an unregulated commercial enterprise    and the new york city department of consumer and worker protection issued a violation against one such star-naming company for engaging in a deceptive trade practice   although stellar parameters can be expressed in si units or gaussian units  it is often most convenient to express mass  luminosity  and radii in solar units based on the characteristics of the sun in  the iau defined a set of solar values defined as si constants without uncertainties which can be used for quoting stellar parameters nominal solar luminosity  nominal solar radius  the solar mass m was not explicitly defined by the iau due to the large relative uncertainty   of the newtonian gravitational constant g since the product of the newtonian gravitational constant and solar mass
together gm  has been determined to much greater precision the iau defined the solar mass parameter to be  the nominal solar mass parameter can be combined with the most recent  codata estimate of the newtonian gravitational constant g to derive the solar mass to be approximately  kg although the exact values for the luminosity radius mass parameter and mass may vary slightly in the future due to observational uncertainties the iau nominal constants will remain the same si values as they remain useful measures for quoting stellar parameters large lengths such as the radius of a giant star or the semi-major axis of a binary star system are often expressed in terms of the astronomical unit approximately equal to the mean distance between the earth and the sun  km or approximately miles in  the iau defined the astronomical constant to be an exact length in meters  m  stellar evolution stars condense from regions of space of higher matter density yet those regions are less dense than within a vacuum chamber  these regionsknown as molecular clouds consist mostly of hydrogen with about to percent helium and a few percent heavier elements one example of such a star-forming region is the orion nebula   most stars form in groups of dozens to hundreds of thousands of stars  massive stars in these groups may powerfully illuminate those clouds ionizing the hydrogen and creating h ii regions  such feedback effects from star formation may ultimately disrupt the cloud and prevent further star formation  all stars spend the majority of their existence as main sequence  fueled primarily by the nuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium within their cores however stars of different masses have markedly different properties at various stages of their development the ultimate fate of more massive stars differs from that of less massive stars as do their luminosities and the impact they have on their environment accordingly astronomers often group stars by their mass  helium red giants helium white dwarfs  age of the universe helium flash asymptotic giant branch planetary nebula red-giant branch red clump supergiants fuse molecular cloud star formation the formation of a star begins with gravitational instability within a molecular cloud caused by regions of higher densityoften triggered by compression of clouds by radiation from massive stars expanding bubbles in the interstellar medium the collision of different molecular clouds or the collision of galaxies as in a starburst galaxy    when a region reaches a sufficient density of matter to satisfy the criteria for jeans instability  it begins to collapse under its own gravitational force  as the cloud collapses individual conglomerations of dense dust and gas form  bok globules  as a globule collapses and the density increases the gravitational energy converts into heat and the temperature rises when the protostellar cloud has approximately reached the stable condition of hydrostatic equilibrium  a protostar forms at the core  these pre-main-sequence stars are often surrounded by a protoplanetary disk and powered mainly by the conversion of gravitational energy the period of gravitational contraction lasts about years for a star like the sun up to years for a red dwarf  early stars of less than are called t tauri stars  while those with greater mass are herbig aebe stars  these newly formed stars emit jets of gas along their axis of rotation which may reduce the angular momentum of the collapsing star and result in small patches of nebulosity known as herbigharo objects    these jets in combination with radiation from nearby massive stars may help to drive away the surrounding cloud from which the star was formed  early in their development t tauri stars follow the hayashi track they contract and decrease in luminosity while remaining at roughly the same temperature less massive t tauri stars follow this track to the main sequence while more massive stars turn onto the henyey track   most stars are observed to be members of binary star systems and the properties of those binaries are the result of the conditions in which they formed  a gas cloud must lose its angular momentum in order to collapse and form a star the fragmentation of the cloud into multiple stars distributes some of that angular momentum the primordial binaries transfer some angular momentum by gravitational interactions during close encounters with other stars in young stellar clusters these interactions tend to split apart more widely separated soft binaries while causing hard binaries to become more tightly bound this produces the separation of binaries into their two observed populations distributions  main sequence stars spend about  of their existence fusing hydrogen into helium in high-temperature and high-pressure reactions in the core region such stars are said to be on the main sequence and are called dwarf stars starting at zero-age main sequence the proportion of helium in a star core will steadily increase the rate of nuclear fusion at the core will slowly increase as will the star temperature and luminosity  the sun for example is estimated to have increased in luminosity by about  since it reached the main sequence    years ago  every star generates a stellar wind of particles that causes a continual outflow of gas into space for most stars the mass lost is negligible the sun loses every year  or about  of its total mass over its entire lifespan however very massive stars can lose to each year significantly affecting their evolution  stars that begin with more than can lose over half their total mass while on the main sequence  hertzsprungrussell diagram classification the time a star spends on the main sequence depends primarily on the amount of fuel it has and the rate at which it fuses it the sun is expected to live   years massive stars consume their fuel very rapidly and are short-lived low mass stars consume their fuel very slowly stars less massive than   called red dwarfs  are able to fuse nearly all of their mass while stars of about can only fuse about  of their mass the combination of their slow fuel-consumption and relatively large usable fuel supply allows low mass stars to last about one trillion   years the most extreme of  will last for about years red dwarfs become hotter and more luminous as they accumulate helium when they eventually run out of hydrogen they contract into a white dwarf and decline in temperature  since the lifespan of such stars is greater than the current age of the universe  years no stars under about   are expected to have moved off the main sequence besides mass the elements heavier than helium can play a significant role in the evolution of stars astronomers label all elements heavier than helium metals and call the chemical concentration of these elements in a star its metallicity  a star metallicity can influence the time the star takes to burn its fuel and controls the formation of its magnetic fields  which affects the strength of its stellar wind  older population ii stars have substantially less metallicity than the younger population i stars due to the composition of the molecular clouds from which they formed over time such clouds become increasingly enriched in heavier elements as older stars die and shed portions of their atmospheres   subgiant red giant horizontal branch red clump asymptotic giant branch betelgeuse alma as stars of at least   exhaust the supply of hydrogen at their core they start to fuse hydrogen in a shell surrounding the helium core the outer layers of the star expand and cool greatly as they transition into a red giant  in some cases they will fuse heavier elements at the core or in shells around the core as the stars expand they throw part of their mass enriched with those heavier elements into the interstellar environment to be recycled later as new stars  in about years when the sun enters the helium burning phase it will expand to a maximum radius of roughly astronomical unit  kilometres times its present size and lose  of its current mass   as the hydrogen-burning shell produces more helium the core increases in mass and temperature in a red giant of up to   the mass of the helium core becomes degenerate prior to helium fusion  finally when the temperature increases sufficiently core helium fusion begins explosively in what is called a helium flash  and the star rapidly shrinks in radius increases its surface temperature and moves to the horizontal branch of the hr diagram for more massive stars helium core fusion starts before the core becomes degenerate and the star spends some time in the red clump  slowly burning helium before the outer convective envelope collapses and the star then moves to the horizontal branch  after a star has fused the helium of its core it begins fusing helium along a shell surrounding the hot carbon core the star then follows an evolutionary path called the asymptotic giant branch agb that parallels the other described red-giant phase but with a higher luminosity the more massive agb stars may undergo a brief period of carbon fusion before the core becomes degenerate during the agb phase stars undergo thermal pulses due to instabilities in the core of the star in these thermal pulses the luminosity of the star varies and matter is ejected from the star atmosphere ultimately forming a planetary nebula as much as  of a star mass can be ejected in this mass loss process because energy transport in an agb star is primarily by convection  this ejected material is enriched with the fusion products dredged up from the core therefore the planetary nebula is enriched with elements like carbon and oxygen ultimately the planetary nebula disperses enriching the general interstellar medium  therefore future generations of stars are made of the star stuff from past stars  supergiant star hypergiant wolfrayet star during their helium-burning phase a star of more than solar masses expands to form first a blue and then a red supergiant  particularly massive stars may evolve to a wolf-rayet star  characterised by spectra dominated by emission lines of elements heavier than hydrogen which have reached the surface due to strong convection and intense mass loss or from stripping of the outer layers  when helium is exhausted at the core of a massive star the core contracts and the temperature and pressure rises enough to fuse carbon see carbon-burning process  this process continues with the successive stages being fueled by neon see neon-burning process  oxygen see oxygen-burning process  and silicon see silicon-burning process  near the end of the star life fusion continues along a series of onion-layer shells within a massive star each shell fuses a different element with the outermost shell fusing hydrogen the next shell fusing helium and so forth  the final stage occurs when a massive star begins producing iron  since iron nuclei are more tightly bound than any heavier nuclei any fusion beyond iron does not produce a net release of energy  as a star core shrinks the intensity of radiation from that surface increases creating such radiation pressure on the outer shell of gas that it will push those layers away forming a planetary nebula if what remains after the outer atmosphere has been shed is less than roughly   it shrinks to a relatively tiny object about the size of earth known as a white dwarf  white dwarfs lack the mass for further gravitational compression to take place  the electron-degenerate matter inside a white dwarf is no longer a plasma eventually white dwarfs fade into black dwarfs over a very long period of time  crab nebula in massive stars fusion continues until the iron core has grown so large more than   that it can no longer support its own mass this core will suddenly collapse as its electrons are driven into its protons forming neutrons neutrinos  and gamma rays in a burst of electron capture and inverse beta decay  the shockwave formed by this sudden collapse causes the rest of the star to explode in a supernova supernovae become so bright that they may briefly outshine the star entire home galaxy when they occur within the milky way supernovae have historically been observed by naked-eye observers as new stars where none seemingly existed before  a supernova explosion blows away the star outer layers leaving a remnant such as the crab nebula  the core is compressed into a neutron star  which sometimes manifests itself as a pulsar or x-ray burster  in the case of the largest stars the remnant is a black hole greater than   in a neutron star the matter is in a state known as neutron-degenerate matter  with a more exotic form of degenerate matter qcd matter  possibly present in the core  the blown-off outer layers of dying stars include heavy elements which may be recycled during the formation of new stars these heavy elements allow the formation of rocky planets the outflow from supernovae and the stellar wind of large stars play an important part in shaping the interstellar medium  the evolution of binary stars may be significantly different from the evolution of single stars of the same mass if stars in a binary system are sufficiently close when one of the stars expands to become a red giant it may overflow its roche lobe  the region around a star where material is gravitationally bound to that star leading to transfer of material to the other when the roche lobe is overflowed a variety of phenomena can result including contact binaries  common-envelope binaries cataclysmic variables  blue stragglers   and type ia supernovae  mass transfer leads to cases such as the algol paradox  where the most-evolved star in a system is the least massive  the evolution of binary and higher-order star systems is intensely reed since so many stars have been found to be members of binary systems around half of sun-like stars and an even higher proportion of more massive stars form in multiple systems and this may greatly influence such phenomena as novae and supernovae the formation of certain types of star and the enrichment of space with nucleosynthesis products  the influence of binary star evolution on the formation of evolved massive stars such as luminous blue variables  wolf-rayet stars and the progenitors of certain classes of core collapse supernova is still disputed single massive stars may be unable to expel their outer layers fast enough to form the types and numbers of evolved stars that are observed or to produce progenitors that would explode as the supernovae that are observed mass transfer through gravitational stripping in binary systems is seen by some astronomers as the solution to that problem    sirius white dwarf a-type main-sequence star stars are not spread uniformly across the universe but are normally grouped into galaxies along with interstellar gas and dust a typical large galaxy like the milky way contains hundreds of billions of stars there are more than   galaxies though most are less than  the mass of the milky way  overall there are likely to be between and stars   more stars than all the grains of sand on planet earth     most stars are within galaxies but between and  of the starlight in large galaxy clusters may come from stars outside of any galaxy    a multi-star system consists of two or more gravitationally bound stars that orbit each other  the simplest and most common multi-star system is a binary star but systems of three or more stars exist for reasons of orbital stability such multi-star systems are often organized into hierarchical sets of binary stars  larger groups are called star clusters these range from loose stellar associations with only a few stars to open clusters with dozens to thousands of stars up to enormous globular clusters with hundreds of thousands of stars such systems orbit their host galaxy the stars in an open or globular cluster all formed from the same giant molecular cloud  so all members normally have similar ages and compositions  many stars are observed and most or all may have originally formed in gravitationally bound multiple-star systems this is particularly true for very massive o and b class stars  of which are believed to be part of multiple-star systems the proportion of single star systems increases with decreasing star mass so that only  of red dwarfs are known to have stellar companions as  of all stars are red dwarfs more than two thirds of stars in the milky way are likely single red dwarfs  in a study of the perseus molecular cloud  astronomers found that most of the newly-formed stars are in binary systems in the model that best explained the data all stars initially formed as binaries though some binaries later split up and leave single stars behind   ngc blue stragglers hertzsprungrussell diagram the nearest star to the earth apart from the sun is proxima centauri   light-years  kilometres away travelling at the orbital speed of the space shuttle  kilometres per second  kilometres per hour it would take about  years to arrive  this is typical of stellar separations in galactic discs   stars can be much closer to each other in the centres of galaxies and in globular clusters or much farther apart in galactic halos  due to the relatively vast distances between stars outside the galactic nucleus collisions between stars are thought to be rare in denser regions such as the core of globular clusters or the galactic center collisions can be more common  such collisions can produce what are known as blue stragglers  these abnormal stars have a higher surface temperature and thus are bluer than stars at the main sequence turnoff in the cluster to which they belong in standard stellar evolution blue stragglers would already have evolved off the main sequence and thus would not be seen in the cluster  almost everything about a star is determined by its initial mass including such characteristics as luminosity size evolution lifespan and its eventual fate stellar age estimation most stars are between and years old some stars may even be close to  years oldthe observed age of the universe  the oldest star yet discovered hd  nicknamed methuselah star is an estimated   years old  due to the uncertainty in the value this age for the star does not conflict with the age of the universe determined by the planck satellite as     the more massive the star the shorter its lifespan primarily because massive stars have greater pressure on their cores causing them to burn hydrogen more rapidly the most massive stars last an average of a few million years while stars of minimum mass red dwarfs burn their fuel very slowly and can last tens to hundreds of billions of years    metallicity molecules in stars when stars form in the present milky way galaxy they are composed of about  hydrogen and  helium  as measured by mass with a small fraction of heavier elements typically the portion of heavy elements is measured in terms of the iron content of the stellar atmosphere as iron is a common element and its absorption lines are relatively easy to measure the portion of heavier elements may be an indicator of the likelihood that the star has a planetary system  the star with the lowest iron content ever measured is the dwarf - with only  the iron content of the sun  by contrast the super-metal-rich star leonis has nearly double the abundance of iron as the sun while the planet-bearing star herculis has nearly triple the iron  chemically peculiar stars show unusual abundances of certain elements in their spectrum especially chromium and rare earth elements   stars with cooler outer atmospheres including the sun can form various diatomic and polyatomic molecules  list of largest stars list of smallest stars solar radius due to their great distance from the earth all stars except the sun appear to the unaided eye as shining points in the night sky that twinkle because of the effect of the earth atmosphere the sun is close enough to the earth to appear as a disk instead and to provide daylight other than the sun the star with the largest apparent size is r doradus  with an angular diameter of only  arcseconds   the disks of most stars are much too small in angular size to be observed with current ground-based optical telescopes and so interferometer telescopes are required to produce images of these objects another technique for measuring the angular size of stars is through occultation  by precisely measuring the drop in brightness of a star as it is occulted by the moon or the rise in brightness when it reappears the star angular diameter can be computed  stars range in size from neutron stars which vary anywhere from to  in diameter to supergiants like betelgeuse in the orion constellation  which has a diameter about  times that of the sun   with a much lower density   stellar kinematics pleiades open cluster constellation taurus  the motion of a star relative to the sun can provide useful information about the origin and age of a star as well as the structure and evolution of the surrounding galaxy the components of motion of a star consist of the radial velocity toward or away from the sun and the traverse angular movement which is called its proper motion radial velocity is measured by the doppler shift of the star spectral lines and is given in units of km s  the proper motion of a star its parallax is determined by precise astrometric measurements in units of milli- arc seconds mas per year with knowledge of the star parallax and its distance the proper motion velocity can be calculated together with the radial velocity the total velocity can be calculated stars with high rates of proper motion are likely to be relatively close to the sun making them good candidates for parallax measurements  when both rates of movement are known the space velocity of the star relative to the sun or the galaxy can be computed among nearby stars it has been found that younger population i stars have generally lower velocities than older population ii stars the latter have elliptical orbits that are inclined to the plane of the galaxy  a comparison of the kinematics of nearby stars has allowed astronomers to trace their origin to common points in giant molecular clouds and are referred to as stellar associations   stellar magnetic field suaur t tauri type zeemandoppler imaging the magnetic field of a star is generated within regions of the interior where convective circulation occurs this movement of conductive plasma functions like a dynamo  wherein the movement of electrical charges induce magnetic fields as does a mechanical dynamo those magnetic fields have a great range that extend throughout and beyond the star the strength of the magnetic field varies with the mass and composition of the star and the amount of magnetic surface activity depends upon the star rate of rotation this surface activity produces starspots  which are regions of strong magnetic fields and lower than normal surface temperatures coronal loops are arching magnetic field flux lines that rise from a star surface into the star outer atmosphere its corona the coronal loops can be seen due to the plasma they conduct along their length stellar flares are bursts of high-energy particles that are emitted due to the same magnetic activity  young rapidly rotating stars tend to have high levels of surface activity because of their magnetic field the magnetic field can act upon a star stellar wind functioning as a brake to gradually slow the rate of rotation with time thus older stars such as the sun have a much slower rate of rotation and a lower level of surface activity the activity levels of slowly rotating stars tend to vary in a cyclical manner and can shut down altogether for periods of time  during
the maunder minimum  for example the sun underwent a
-year period with almost no sunspot activity  stellar mass one of the most massive stars known is eta carinae   which
with as much mass as the sun will have a lifespan of only several million years studies of the most massive open clusters suggests as a rough upper limit for stars in the current era of the universe  this
represents an empirical value for the theoretical limit on the mass of forming stars due to increasing radiation pressure on the accreting gas cloud several stars in the cluster in the large magellanic cloud have been measured with larger masses  but
it has been determined that they could have been created through the collision and merger of massive stars in close binary systems sidestepping the limit on massive star formation  reflection nebula ngc orionis dark nebula the first stars to form after the big bang may have been larger up to   due
to the complete absence of elements heavier than lithium in their composition this generation of supermassive population iii stars is likely to have existed in the very early universe ie they are observed to have a high redshift and may have started the production of chemical elements heavier than hydrogen that are needed for the later formation of planets and life  in june  astronomers reported evidence for population iii stars in the cosmos redshift galaxy at    with a mass only that of jupiter   - is the smallest known star undergoing nuclear fusion in its core  for
stars with metallicity similar to the sun the theoretical minimum mass the star can have and still undergo fusion at the core is estimated to be about    when the metallicity is very low the minimum star size seems to be about  of the solar mass or about    smaller bodies called brown dwarfs  occupy a poorly defined grey area between stars and gas giants    the combination of the radius and the mass of a star determines its surface gravity giant stars have a much lower surface gravity than do main sequence stars while the opposite is the case for degenerate compact stars such as white dwarfs the surface gravity can influence the appearance of a star spectrum with higher gravity causing a broadening of the absorption lines   stellar rotation the rotation rate of stars can be determined through spectroscopic measurement  or more exactly determined by tracking their starspots  young stars can have a rotation greater than s at the equator the b-class star achernar  for example has an equatorial velocity of about s or greater causing its equator to bulge outward and giving it an equatorial diameter that is more than  greater than between the poles this rate of rotation is just below the critical velocity of s at which speed the star would break apart  by contrast the sun rotates once every days depending on latitude  with an equatorial velocity of s  a main sequence star magnetic field and the stellar wind serve to slow its rotation by a significant amount as it evolves on the main sequence  degenerate stars have contracted into a compact mass resulting in a rapid rate of rotation however they have relatively low rates of rotation compared to what would be expected by conservation of angular momentumthe tendency of a rotating body to compensate for a contraction in size by increasing its rate of spin a large portion of the star angular momentum is dissipated as a result of mass loss through the stellar wind  in spite of this the rate of rotation for a pulsar can be very rapid the pulsar at the heart of the crab nebula  for example rotates times per second  the rotation rate of the pulsar will gradually slow due to the emission of radiation  the surface temperature of a main sequence star is determined by the rate of energy production of its core and by its radius and is often estimated from the star color index   the temperature is normally given in terms of an effective temperature  which is the temperature of an idealized black body that radiates its energy at the same luminosity per surface area as the star the effective temperature is only representative of the surface as the temperature increases toward the core  the temperature in the core region of a star is several million kelvins   the stellar temperature will determine the rate of ionization of various elements resulting in characteristic absorption lines in the spectrum the surface temperature of a star along with its visual absolute magnitude and absorption features is used to classify a star see classification below  massive main sequence stars can have surface temperatures of  smaller stars such as the sun have surface temperatures of a few thousand k red giants have relatively low surface temperatures of about  but they have a high luminosity due to their large exterior surface area  the energy produced by stars a product of nuclear fusion radiates to space as both electromagnetic radiation and particle radiation  the particle radiation emitted by a star is manifested as the stellar wind  which
streams from the outer layers as electrically charged protons and alpha and beta particles  a steady stream of almost massless neutrinos emanate directly from the star core  the production of energy at the core is the reason stars shine so brightly every time two or more atomic nuclei fuse together to form a single atomic nucleus of a new heavier element gamma ray photons are released from the nuclear fusion product this energy is converted to other forms of electromagnetic energy of lower frequency such as visible light by the time it reaches the star outer layers  the color of a star as determined by the most intense frequency of the visible light depends on the temperature of the star outer layers including its photosphere   besides visible light stars emit forms of electromagnetic radiation that are invisible to the human eye  in fact stellar electromagnetic radiation spans the entire electromagnetic spectrum  from the longest wavelengths of radio waves through infrared  visible light ultraviolet  to the shortest of x-rays  and gamma rays from the standpoint of total energy emitted by a star not all components of stellar electromagnetic radiation are significant but all frequencies provide insight into the star physics  using the stellar spectrum  astronomers can determine the surface temperature surface gravity  metallicity and rotational velocity of a star if the distance of the star is found such as by measuring the parallax then the luminosity of the star can be derived the mass radius surface gravity and rotation period can then be estimated based on stellar models mass can be calculated for stars in binary systems by measuring their orbital velocities and distances gravitational microlensing has been used to measure the mass of a single star   with these parameters astronomers can estimate the age of the star  the luminosity of a star is the amount of light and other forms of radiant energy it radiates per unit of time it has units of power  the luminosity of a star is determined by its radius and surface temperature many stars do not radiate uniformly across their entire surface the rapidly rotating star vega  for example has a higher energy flux power per unit area at its poles than along its equator  patches of the star surface with a lower temperature and luminosity than average are known as starspots  small stars such as our sun generally have essentially featureless disks with only small starspots stars have much larger more obvious starspots  and
they exhibit strong stellar limb darkening  that is the brightness decreases towards the edge of the stellar disk  red dwarf flare stars such as uv ceti may possess prominent starspot features  apparent magnitude absolute magnitude the apparent brightness of a star is expressed in terms of its apparent magnitude  it is a function of the star luminosity its distance from earth the extinction effect of interstellar dust and gas and the altering of the star light as it passes through earth atmosphere intrinsic or absolute magnitude is directly related to a star luminosity and is the apparent magnitude a star would be if the distance between the earth and the star were parsecs  light-years   both the apparent and absolute magnitude scales are logarithmic units  one whole number difference in magnitude is equal to a brightness variation of about  times  the root of or approximately  this means that a first magnitude star  is about  times brighter than a second magnitude  star and about times brighter than a sixth magnitude star  the faintest stars visible to the naked eye under good seeing conditions are about magnitude   on both apparent and absolute magnitude scales the smaller the magnitude number the brighter the star the larger the magnitude number the fainter the star the brightest stars on either scale have negative magnitude numbers the variation in brightness   between two stars is calculated by subtracting the magnitude number of the brighter star   from the magnitude number of the fainter star   then using the difference as an exponent for the base number  that is to say relative to both luminosity and distance from earth a star absolute magnitude   and apparent magnitude   are not equivalent  for example the bright star sirius has an apparent magnitude of  but it has an absolute magnitude of  the sun has an apparent magnitude of  but its absolute magnitude is only  sirius the brightest star in the night sky as seen from earth is approximately times more luminous than the sun while canopus  the second brightest star in the night sky with an absolute magnitude of  is approximately  times more luminous than the sun despite canopus being vastly more luminous than sirius the latter star appears the brighter of the two this is because sirius is merely  light-years from the earth while canopus is much farther away at a distance of light-years  the most luminous known stars have absolute magnitudes of roughly  corresponding to million times the luminosity of the sun  theoretically the least luminous stars are at the lower limit of mass at which stars are capable of supporting nuclear fusion of hydrogen in the core stars just above this limit have been located in the ngc cluster the faintest red dwarfs in the cluster are absolute magnitude  while a absolute magnitude white dwarf has been discovered   stellar classification  zeta ophiuchi rigel altair procyona sun epsilon indi proxima centauri the current stellar classification system originated in the early century when stars were classified from to based on the strength of the hydrogen line   it was thought that the hydrogen line strength was a simple linear function of temperature instead it was more complicated it strengthened with increasing temperature peaked near  and then declined at greater temperatures the classifications were since reordered by temperature on which the modern scheme is based  stars are given a single-letter classification according to their spectra ranging from type  which are very hot to  which are so cool that molecules may form in their atmospheres the main classifications in order of decreasing surface temperature are  and  a variety of rare spectral types are given special classifications the most common of these are types and  which classify the coldest low-mass stars and brown dwarfs each letter has sub-divisions numbered from to  in order of decreasing temperature however this system breaks down at extreme high temperatures as classes and may not exist  in addition stars may be classified by the luminosity effects found in their spectral lines which correspond to their spatial size and is determined by their surface gravity these range from  hypergiants  through  giants  to main sequence dwarfs some authors add white dwarfs main sequence stars fall along a narrow diagonal band when graphed according to their absolute magnitude and spectral type  the sun is a main sequence yellow dwarf of intermediate temperature and ordinary size  there is additional nomenclature in the form of lower-case letters added to the end of the spectral type to indicate peculiar features of the spectrum for example an   can indicate the presence of emission lines   represents unusually strong levels of metals and   can mean variations in the spectral type  white dwarf stars have their own class that begins with the letter  this is further sub-divided into the classes      and  depending on the types of prominent lines found in the spectrum this is followed by a numerical value that indicates the temperature  variable star mira variable stars have periodic or random changes in luminosity because of intrinsic or extrinsic properties of the intrinsically variable stars the primary types can be subdivided into three principal groups during their stellar evolution some stars pass through phases where they can become pulsating variables pulsating variable stars vary in radius and luminosity over time expanding and contracting with periods ranging from minutes to years depending on the size of the star this category includes cepheid and cepheid-like stars  and long-period variables such as mira   eruptive variables are stars that experience sudden increases in luminosity because of flares or mass ejection events  this group includes protostars wolf-rayet stars and flare stars as well as giant and supergiant stars cataclysmic or explosive variable stars are those that undergo a dramatic change in their properties this group includes novae and supernovae a binary star system that includes a nearby white dwarf can produce certain types of these spectacular stellar explosions including the nova and a type supernova  the explosion is created when the white dwarf accretes hydrogen from the companion star building up mass until the hydrogen undergoes fusion  some novae are recurrent having periodic outbursts of moderate amplitude  stars can vary in luminosity because of extrinsic factors such as eclipsing binaries as well as rotating stars that produce extreme starspots  a notable example of an eclipsing binary is algol which regularly varies in magnitude from  to  over a period of  days  stellar structure red dwarf yellow dwarf blue-white main sequence star the interior of a stable star is in a state of hydrostatic equilibrium  the forces on any small volume almost exactly counterbalance each other the balanced forces are inward gravitational force and an outward force due to the pressure gradient within the star the pressure gradient is established by the temperature gradient of the plasma the outer part of the star is cooler than the core the temperature at the core of a main sequence or giant star is at least on the order of k the resulting temperature and pressure at the hydrogen-burning core of a main sequence star are sufficient for nuclear fusion to occur and for sufficient energy to be produced to prevent further collapse of the star   as atomic nuclei are fused in the core they emit energy in the form of gamma rays these photons interact with the surrounding plasma adding to the thermal energy at the core stars on the main sequence convert hydrogen into helium creating a slowly but steadily increasing proportion of helium in the core eventually the helium content becomes predominant and energy production ceases at the core instead for stars of more than   fusion occurs in a slowly expanding shell around the degenerate helium core  in addition to hydrostatic equilibrium the interior of a stable star will maintain an energy balance of thermal equilibrium  there is a radial temperature gradient throughout the interior that results in a flux of energy flowing toward the exterior the outgoing flux of energy leaving any layer within the star will exactly match the incoming flux from below  the radiation zone is the region of the stellar interior where the flux of energy outward is dependent on radiative heat transfer since convective heat transfer is inefficient in that zone in this region the plasma will not be perturbed and any mass motions will die out if this is not the case then the plasma becomes unstable and convection will occur forming a convection zone  this can occur for example in regions where very high energy fluxes occur such as near the core or in areas with high opacity making radiatative heat transfer inefficient as in the outer envelope  the occurrence of convection in the outer envelope of a main sequence star depends on the star mass stars with several times the mass of the sun have a convection zone deep within the interior and a radiative zone in the outer layers smaller stars such as the sun are just the opposite with the convective zone located in the outer layers  red dwarf stars with less than  are convective throughout which prevents the accumulation of a helium core  for most stars the convective zones will vary over time as the star ages and the constitution of the interior is modified  sun the photosphere is that portion of a star that is visible to an observer this is the layer at which the plasma of the star becomes transparent to photons of light from here the energy generated at the core becomes free to propagate into space it is within the photosphere that sun spots  regions of lower than average temperature appear  above the level of the photosphere is the stellar atmosphere in a main sequence star such as the sun the lowest level of the atmosphere just above the photosphere is the thin chromosphere region where spicules appear and stellar flares begin above this is the transition region where the temperature rapidly increases within a distance of only  beyond this is the corona  a volume of super-heated plasma that can extend outward to several million kilometres  the existence of a corona appears to be dependent on a convective zone in the outer layers of the star  despite its high temperature and the corona emits very little light due to its low gas density the corona region of the sun is normally only visible during a solar eclipse  from the corona a stellar wind of plasma particles expands outward from the star until it interacts with the interstellar medium for the sun the influence of its solar wind extends throughout a bubble-shaped region called the heliosphere   stellar nucleosynthesis when nuclei fuse the mass of the fused product is less than the mass of the original parts this lost mass is converted to electromagnetic energy according to the massenergy equivalence relationship    a variety of nuclear fusion reactions take place in the cores of stars that depend upon their mass and composition the hydrogen fusion process is temperature-sensitive so a moderate increase in the core temperature will result in a significant increase in the fusion rate as a result the core temperature of main sequence stars only varies from kelvin for a small m-class star to kelvin for a massive o-class star  in the sun with a -million-kelvin core hydrogen fuses to form helium in the protonproton chain reaction   h h e ev e e he he there are a couple other paths in which he and he combine to form be which eventually with the addition of another proton yields two he a gain of one all these reactions result in the overall reaction where is a gamma ray photon is a neutrino and h and he are isotopes of hydrogen and helium respectively the energy released by this reaction is in millions of electron volts each individual reaction produces only a tiny amount of energy but because enormous numbers of these reactions occur constantly they produce all the energy necessary to sustain the star radiation output in comparison the combustion of two hydrogen gas molecules with one oxygen gas molecule releases only  ev in more massive stars helium is produced in a cycle of reactions catalyzed by carbon called the carbon-nitrogen-oxygen cycle   in evolved stars with cores at kelvin and masses between  and  helium can be transformed into carbon in the triple-alpha process that uses the intermediate element beryllium   be c for an overall reaction of in massive stars heavier elements can be burned in a contracting core through the neon-burning process and oxygen-burning process  the final stage in the stellar nucleosynthesis process is the silicon-burning process that results in the production of the stable isotope iron-  any further fusion would be an endothermic process that consumes energy and so further energy can only be produced through gravitational collapse  stars portal astronomy portal fusor astronomy outline of astronomy sidereal time star clocks

abbreviations sn and sne  is a powerful and luminous stellar explosion  this transient astronomical event occurs during the last evolutionary stages of a massive star or when a white dwarf is triggered into runaway nuclear fusion  the original object called the  either collapses to a neutron star or black hole  or is completely destroyed the peak optical luminosity of a supernova can be comparable to that of an entire galaxy before fading over several weeks or months supernovae are more energetic than novae  in latin  means new referring astronomically to what appears to be a temporary new bright star adding the prefix super- distinguishes supernovae from ordinary novae which are far less luminous the word was coined by walter baade and fritz zwicky in  the most recent directly observed supernova in the milky way was kepler supernova in  but the remnants of more recent supernovae have been found observations of supernovae in other galaxies suggest they occur in the milky way on average about three times every century these supernovae would almost certainly be observable with modern astronomical telescopes the most recent naked-eye supernova was sn  the explosion of a blue supergiant star in the large magellanic cloud  a satellite of the milky way theoretical studies indicate that most supernovae are triggered by one of two basic mechanisms the sudden re-ignition of nuclear fusion in a degenerate star such as a white dwarf or the sudden gravitational collapse of a massive star core  in the first class of events the object temperature is raised enough to trigger runaway nuclear fusion completely disrupting the star possible causes are an accumulation of material from a binary companion through accretion  or a stellar merger  in the massive star case the core of a massive star may undergo sudden collapse releasing gravitational potential energy as a supernova while some observed supernovae are more complex than these two simplified theories the astrophysical mechanics are established and accepted by the astronomical community supernovae can expel several solar masses of material at speeds up to several percent of the speed of light  this drives an expanding shock wave into the surrounding interstellar medium  sweeping up an expanding shell of gas and dust observed as a supernova remnant  supernovae are a major source of elements in the interstellar medium from oxygen to rubidium  the expanding shock waves of supernovae can trigger the formation of new stars  supernova remnants might be a major source of cosmic rays  supernovae might produce gravitational waves  though thus far gravitational waves have been detected only from the mergers of black holes and neutron stars contents edit history of supernova observation crab nebula pulsar wind nebula supernova compared to a star entire history the visual appearance of a supernova is very brief perhaps spanning several months so that the chances of observing one with the naked eye is roughly once in a lifetime only a tiny fraction of the stars in a typical galaxy have the capacity to become a supernova restricted to either those having large mass or extraordinarily rare kinds of binary stars containing white dwarfs   the earliest possible recorded supernova known as  could have been viewed and recorded by unknown indian observers in bc   later sn was viewed by chinese astronomers in ad the brightest recorded supernova was sn  which occurred in ad in the constellation of lupus  and was described by observers across china japan iraq egypt and europe    the widely observed supernova sn produced the crab nebula  supernovae sn and sn  the latest to be observed with the naked eye in the milky way galaxy had notable effects on the development of astronomy in europe because they were used to argue against the aristotelian idea that the universe beyond the moon and planets was static and unchanging  johannes kepler began observing sn at its peak on october   and continued to make estimates of its brightness until it faded from naked eye view a year later  it was the second supernova to be observed in a generation after sn seen by tycho brahe in cassiopeia  there is some evidence that the youngest galactic supernova   occurred in the late century considerably more recently than cassiopeia a from around   neither supernova was noted at the time in the case of  high extinction along the plane of the galaxy could have dimmed the event sufficiently to go unnoticed the situation for cassiopeia a is less clear infrared light echos have been detected showing that it was a type iib supernova and was not in a region of especially high extinction   observation and discovery of extragalactic supernovae are now far more common the first such observation was of sn in the andromeda galaxy  today amateur and professional astronomers are finding several hundred every year some when near maximum brightness others on old astronomical photographs or plates american astronomers rudolph minkowski and fritz zwicky developed the modern supernova classification scheme beginning in   during the  astronomers found that the maximum intensities of supernovae could be used as standard candles  hence indicators of astronomical distances  some of the most distant supernovae observed in appeared dimmer than expected this supports the view that the expansion of the universe is accelerating   techniques were developed for reconstructing supernovae events that have no written records of being observed the date of the cassiopeia a supernova event was determined from light echoes off nebulae   while the age of supernova remnant rx - was estimated from temperature measurements  and the gamma ray emissions from the radioactive decay of titanium-    the most luminous supernova ever recorded is asassn-  at a distance of  gigalight-years  it was first detected in june and peaked at billion  which is twice the bolometric luminosity of any other known supernova  however the nature of this supernova continues to be debated and several alternative explanations have been suggested eg tidal disruption of a star by a black hole  among the earliest detected since time of detonation and for which the earliest spectra have been obtained beginning at hours after the actual explosion is the type ii sn  which was recorded hours after the supernova event on october by the intermediate palomar transient factory iptf the star is located in a spiral galaxy named ngc  light-years away in the constellation of pegasus   on september  amateur astronomer victor buso from rosario  argentina was testing his telescope   when taking several photographs of galaxy ngc  buso chanced upon a supernova that had just become visible on earth after examining the images he contacted the instituto de astrofsica de la plata it was the first time anyone had ever captured the initial moments of the breakout from an optical supernova one not associated with a gamma-ray or x-ray burst  the odds of capturing such an event were put between one in ten million to one in a hundred million according to astronomer melina bersten from the instituto de astrofsica
the supernova buso observed was a type iib made by a star twenty times the mass of the sun  astronomer alex filippenko  from the university of california  remarked that professional astronomers had been ing for such an event for a long time he stated observations of stars in the first moments they begin exploding provide information that cannot be directly obtained in any other way  edit history of supernova observation telescope observation supernova remnant large magellanic cloud early work on what was originally believed to be simply a new category of novae was performed during the  these were variously called upper-class novae hauptnovae or giant novae  the name supernovae is thought to have been coined by walter baade and fritz zwicky in lectures at caltech during  it was used as super-novae in a journal paper published by knut lundmark in   and in a paper by baade and zwicky  by  the hyphen had been lost and the modern name was in use  because supernovae are relatively rare events within a galaxy occurring about three times a century in the milky way  obtaining a good sample of supernovae to study requires regular monitoring of many galaxies supernovae in other galaxies cannot be predicted with any meaningful accuracy normally when they are discovered they are already in progress  to use supernovae as standard candles for measuring distance observation of their peak luminosity is required it is therefore important to discover them well before they reach their maximum amateur astronomers  who greatly outnumber professional astronomers have played an important role in finding supernovae typically by looking at some of the closer galaxies through an optical telescope and comparing them to earlier photographs  toward the end of the century astronomers increasingly turned to computer-controlled telescopes and ccds for hunting supernovae while such systems are popular with amateurs there are also professional installations such as the katzman automatic imaging telescope   the supernova early warning system snews project uses a network of neutrino detectors to give early warning of a supernova in the milky way galaxy   neutrinos are particles that are produced in great quantities by a supernova and they are not significantly absorbed by the interstellar gas and dust of the galactic disk  carina nebula supernova es fall into two classes those focused on relatively nearby events and those looking farther away because of the expansion of the universe  the distance to a remote object with a known emission spectrum can be estimated by measuring its doppler shift or redshift  on average more-distant objects recede with greater velocity than those nearby and so have a higher redshift thus the  is split between high redshift and low redshift with the boundary falling around a redshift range of   where is a dimensionless measure of the spectrum frequency shift high redshift es for supernovae usually involve the observation of supernova light curves these are useful for standard or calibrated candles to generate hubble diagrams and make cosmological predictions supernova spectroscopy used to study the physics and environments of supernovae is more practical at low than at high redshift   low redshift observations also anchor the low-distance end of the hubble curve  which is a plot of distance versus redshift for visible galaxies   edit x-ray infrared optical kepler supernova remnant sn supernova discoveries are reported to the international astronomical union central bureau for astronomical telegrams  which sends out a circular with the name it assigns to that supernova the name is formed from the prefix  followed by the year of discovery suffixed with a one or two-letter designation the first supernovae of the year are designated with a capital letter from to  afterward pairs of lower-case letters are used   and so on hence for example designates the third supernova reported in the year   the last supernova of  sn  was the     the suffix nc acts as a bijective base- encoding with          since  professional and amateur astronomers have been finding several hundreds of supernovae each year  in  in  in  in    historical supernovae are known simply by the year they occurred sn  sn  sn  sn called  and sn   since the additional letter notation has been used even if there was only one supernova discovered that year eg sn  sn  etcthis last happened with sn   for supernova is a standard prefix until  two-letter designations were rarely needed since  however they have been needed every year since  the increasing number of discoveries has regularly led to the additional use of three-digit designations  edit  astronomers classify supernovae according to their light curves and the absorption lines of different chemical elements that appear in their spectra  if a supernova spectrum contains lines of hydrogen known as the balmer series in the visual portion of the spectrum it is classified  otherwise it is  in each of these two types there are subdivisions according to the presence of lines from other elements or the shape of the light curve a graph of the supernova apparent magnitude as a function of time     type ia ionised silicon nm thermal runaway type ibc helium core collapse type ii type ii-p-ln type ii-pl type ii-p type ii-l  type iin type iib edit type i supernovae are subdivided on the basis of their spectra with type ia showing a strong ionised silicon absorption line  type i supernovae without this strong line are classified as type ib and ic with type ib showing strong neutral helium lines and type ic lacking them the light curves are all similar although type ia are generally brighter at peak luminosity but the light curve is not important for classification of type i supernovae a small number of type ia supernovae exhibit unusual features such as non-standard luminosity or broadened light curves and these are typically classified by referring to the earliest example showing similar features for example the sub-luminous sn is often referred to as sn -like or class ia- a small proportion of type ic supernovae show highly broadened and blended emission lines which are taken to indicate very high expansion velocities for the ejecta these have been classified as type ic-bl or ic-bl  edit the supernovae of type ii can also be sub-divided based on their spectra while most type ii supernovae show very broad emission lines which indicate expansion velocities of many thousands of kilometres per second  some such as sn  have relatively narrow features in their spectra these are called type iin where the  stands for  a few supernovae such as sn  and sn  appear to change types they show lines of hydrogen at early times but over a period of weeks to months become dominated by lines of helium the term type iib is used to describe the combination of features normally associated with types ii and ib  type ii supernovae with normal spectra dominated by broad hydrogen lines that remain for the life of the decline are classified on the basis of their light curves the most common type shows a distinctive plateau in the light curve shortly after peak brightness where the visual luminosity stays relatively constant for several months before the decline resumes these are called type ii-p referring to the plateau less common are type ii-l supernovae that lack a distinct plateau the l signifies linear although the light curve is not actually a straight line supernovae that do not fit into the normal classifications are designated peculiar or   edit fritz zwicky defined additional supernovae types based on a very few examples that did not cleanly fit the parameters for type i or type ii supernovae sn in ngc was the prototype and only member of the type iii supernova class noted for its broad light curve maximum and broad hydrogen balmer lines that were slow to develop in the spectrum sn in ngc was the prototype and only member of the type iv class with a light curve similar to a type ii-p supernova with hydrogen absorption lines but weak hydrogen emission lines  the type v class was coined for sn in ngc  an unusual faint supernova or supernova impostor with a slow rise to brightness a maximum lasting many months and an unusual emission spectrum the similarity of sn to the eta carinae great outburst was noted  supernovae in  and  and  were also suggested as possible type iv or type v supernovae  these types would now all be treated as peculiar type ii supernovae iipec of which many more examples have been discovered although it is still debated whether sn was a true supernova following an lbv outburst or an impostor  edit ngc  supernovae type codes as described above are taxonomic  the type number describes the light observed from the supernova not necessarily its cause for example type ia supernovae are produced by runaway fusion ignited on degenerate white dwarf progenitors while the spectrally similar type ibc are produced from massive wolfrayet progenitors by core collapse the following summarises what is currently believed to be the most plausible explanations for supernovae edit type ia supernova a white dwarf star may accumulate sufficient material from a stellar companion to raise its core temperature enough to ignite carbon fusion  at which point it undergoes runaway nuclear fusion completely disrupting it there are three avenues by which this detonation is theorised to happen stable accretion of material from a companion the collision of two white dwarfs or accretion that causes ignition in a shell that then ignites the core the dominant mechanism by which type ia supernovae are produced remains unclear  despite this uncertainty in how type ia supernovae are produced type ia supernovae have very uniform properties and are useful standard candles over intergalactic distances some calibrations are required to compensate for the gradual change in properties or different frequencies of abnormal luminosity supernovae at high redshift and for small variations in brightness identified by light curve shape or spectrum   edit there are several means by which a supernova of this type can form but they share a common underlying mechanism if a carbon - oxygen white dwarf accreted enough matter to reach the chandrasekhar limit of about  solar masses    for a non-rotating star it would no longer be able to support the bulk of its mass through electron degeneracy pressure   and would begin to collapse however the current view is that this limit is not normally attained increasing temperature and density inside the core ignite carbon fusion as the star approaches the limit to within about    before collapse is initiated  for a core primarily composed of oxygen neon and magnesium the collapsing white dwarf will typically form a neutron star  in this case only a fraction of the star mass will be ejected during the collapse  within a few seconds a substantial fraction of the matter in the white dwarf undergoes nuclear fusion releasing enough energy  j   to unbind the star in a supernova  an outwardly expanding shock wave is generated with matter reaching velocities on the order of  kms  or roughly  of the speed of light there is also a significant increase in luminosity reaching an absolute magnitude of  or times brighter than the sun with little variation  the model for the formation of this category of supernova is a close binary star system the larger of the two stars is the first to evolve off the main sequence  and it expands to form a red giant  the two stars now share a common envelope causing their mutual orbit to shrink the giant star then sheds most of its envelope losing mass until it can no longer continue nuclear fusion  at this point it becomes a white dwarf star composed primarily of carbon and oxygen  eventually the secondary star also evolves off the main sequence to form a red giant matter from the giant is accreted by the white dwarf causing the latter to increase in mass despite widespread acceptance of the basic model the exact details of initiation and of the heavy elements produced in the catastrophic event are still unclear type ia supernovae follow a characteristic light curve the graph of luminosity as a function of timeafter the event this luminosity is generated by the radioactive decay of nickel - through cobalt - to iron -  the peak luminosity of the light curve is extremely consistent across normal type ia supernovae having a maximum absolute magnitude of about  this is because type ia supernovae arise from a consistent type of progenitor star by gradual mass acquisition and explode when they acquire a consistent typical mass giving rise to very similar supernova conditions and behavior this allows them to be used as a secondary  standard candle to measure the distance to their host galaxies  edit another model for the formation of type ia supernovae involves the merger of two white dwarf stars with the combined mass momentarily exceeding the chandrasekhar limit   there is much variation in this type of event  and in many cases there may be no supernova at all in which case they will have a broader and less luminous light curve than the more normal sn type ia abnormally bright type ia supernovae occur when the white dwarf already has a mass higher than the chandrasekhar limit  possibly enhanced further by asymmetry  but the ejected material will have less than normal kinetic energy there is no formal sub-classification for the non-standard type ia supernovae it has been proposed that a group of sub-luminous supernovae that occur when helium accretes onto a white dwarf should be classified as type iax    this type of supernova may not always completely destroy the white dwarf progenitor and could leave behind a zombie star   one specific type of non-standard type ia supernova develops hydrogen and other emission lines and gives the appearance of mixture between a normal type ia and a type iin supernova examples are sn and sn  these supernovae have been dubbed type iaiin  type ian  type iia and type iian   edit very massive stars can undergo core collapse when nuclear fusion becomes unable to sustain the core against its own gravity passing this threshold is the cause of all types of supernova except type ia the collapse may cause violent expulsion of the outer layers of the star resulting in a supernova or the release of gravitational potential energy may be insufficient and the star may collapse into a black hole or neutron star with little radiated energy core collapse can be caused by several different mechanisms exceeding the chandrasekhar limit  electron capture  pair-instability  or photodisintegration    electron degeneracy pressure degenerate gravitational collapse stellar core the table below lists the known reasons for core collapse in massive stars the types of stars in which they occur their associated supernova type and the remnant produced the metallicity is the proportion of elements other than hydrogen or helium as compared to the sun the initial mass is the mass of the star prior to the supernova event given in multiples of the sun mass although the mass at the time of the supernova may be much lower type iin supernovae are not listed in the table they can be produced by various types of core collapse in different progenitor stars possibly even by type ia white dwarf ignitions although it seems that most will be from iron core collapse in luminous supergiants or hypergiants including lbvs  the narrow spectral lines for which they are named occur because the supernova is expanding into a small dense cloud of circumstellar material  it appears that a significant proportion of supposed type iin supernovae are supernova impostors  massive eruptions of lbv -like stars similar to the great eruption of eta carinae  in these events material previously ejected from the star creates the narrow absorption lines and causes a shock wave through interaction with the newly ejected material   solar masses electron capture in a degenerate onemg core hypernova gamma-ray burst when a stellar core is no longer supported against gravity it collapses in on itself with velocities reaching s    resulting in a rapid increase in temperature and density what follows next depends on the mass and structure of the collapsing core with low-mass degenerate cores forming neutron stars higher-mass degenerate cores mostly collapsing completely to black holes and non-degenerate cores undergoing runaway fusion the initial collapse of degenerate cores is accelerated by beta decay  photodisintegration and electron capture which causes a burst of electron neutrinos  as the density increases neutrino emission is cut off as they become trapped in the core the inner core eventually reaches typically km in diameter  and a density comparable to that of an atomic nucleus  and neutron degeneracy pressure tries to halt the collapse if the core mass is more than about then neutron degeneracy is insufficient to stop the collapse and a black hole forms directly with no supernova in lower mass cores the collapse is stopped and the newly formed neutron core has an initial temperature of about kelvin  times the temperature of the sun core  at this temperature neutrino-antineutrino pairs of all flavours are efficiently formed by thermal emission  these thermal neutrinos are several times more abundant than the electron-capture neutrinos  about joules approximately  of the star rest mass is converted into a ten-second burst of neutrinos which is the main output of the event   the suddenly halted core collapse rebounds and produces a shock wave that stalls within milliseconds  in the outer core as energy is lost through the dissociation of heavy elements a process that is not clearly understood update is necessary to allow the outer layers of the core to reabsorb around joules   foe  from the neutrino pulse producing the visible brightness although there are also other theories on how to power the explosion  some material from the outer envelope falls back onto the neutron star and for cores beyond about  there is sufficient fallback to form a black hole this fallback will reduce the kinetic energy created and the mass of expelled radioactive material but in some situations it may also generate relativistic jets that result in a gamma-ray burst or an exceptionally luminous supernova the collapse of a massive non-degenerate core will ignite further fusion when the core collapse is initiated by pair instability oxygen fusion begins and the collapse may be halted for core masses of  the collapse halts and the star remains intact but collapse will occur again when a larger core has formed for cores of around  the fusion of oxygen and heavier elements is so energetic that the entire star is disrupted causing a supernova at the upper end of the mass range the supernova is unusually luminous and extremely long-lived due to many solar masses of ejected ni for even larger core masses the core temperature becomes high enough to allow photodisintegration and the core collapses completely into a black hole  edit type ii supernova sn stars with initial masses less than about never develop a core large enough to collapse and they eventually lose their atmospheres to become white dwarfs stars with at least possibly as much as   evolve in a complex fashion progressively burning heavier elements at hotter temperatures in their cores   the star becomes layered like an onion with the burning of more easily fused elements occurring in larger shells   although popularly described as an onion with an iron core the least massive supernova progenitors only have oxygen - neon - magnesium  cores these super-agb stars may form the majority of core collapse supernovae although less luminous and so less commonly observed than those from more massive progenitors  if core collapse occurs during a supergiant phase when the star still has a hydrogen envelope the result is a type ii supernova the rate of mass loss for luminous stars depends on the metallicity and luminosity  extremely luminous stars at near solar metallicity will lose all their hydrogen before they reach core collapse and so will not form a type ii supernova at low metallicity all stars will reach core collapse with a hydrogen envelope but sufficiently massive stars collapse directly to a black hole without producing a visible supernova stars with an initial mass up to about times the sun or a little less at high metallicity result in a type ii-p supernova which is the most commonly observed type at moderate to high metallicity stars near the upper end of that mass range will have lost most of their hydrogen when core collapse occurs and the result will be a type ii-l supernova at very low metallicity stars of around will reach core collapse by pair instability while they still have a hydrogen atmosphere and an oxygen core and the result will be a supernova with type ii characteristics but a very large mass of ejected ni and high luminosity edit type ib and ic supernovae  x-ray  these supernovae like those of type ii are massive stars that undergo core collapse however the stars which become types ib and ic supernovae have lost most of their outer hydrogen envelopes due to strong stellar winds or else from interaction with a companion  these stars are known as wolfrayet stars  and they occur at moderate to high metallicity where continuum driven winds cause sufficiently high mass-loss rates observations of type ibc supernova do not match the observed or expected occurrence of wolfrayet stars and alternate explanations for this type of core collapse supernova involve stars stripped of their hydrogen by binary interactions binary models provide a better match for the observed supernovae with the proviso that no suitable binary helium stars have ever been observed  since a supernova can occur whenever the mass of the star at the time of core collapse is low enough not to cause complete fallback to a black hole any massive star may result in a supernova if it loses enough mass before core collapse occurs type ib supernovae are the more common and result from wolfrayet stars of type wc which still have helium in their atmospheres for a narrow range of masses stars evolve further before reaching core collapse to become wo stars with very little helium remaining and these are the progenitors of type ic supernovae a few percent of the type ic supernovae are associated with gamma-ray bursts grb though it is also believed that any hydrogen-stripped type ib or ic supernova could produce a grb depending on the circumstances of the geometry  the mechanism for producing this type of grb is the jets produced by the magnetic field of the rapidly spinning magnetar formed at the collapsing core of the star the jets would also transfer energy into the expanding outer shell producing a super-luminous supernova    ultra-stripped supernovae occur when the exploding star has been stripped almost all the way to the metal core via mass transfer in a close binary  as a result very little material is ejected from the exploding star c   in the most extreme cases ultra-stripped supernovae can occur in naked metal cores barely above the chandrasekhar mass limit sn  might be an observational example of an ultra-stripped supernova giving rise to a relatively dim and fast decaying light curve the nature of ultra-stripped supernovae can be both iron core-collapse and electron capture supernovae depending on the mass of the collapsing core edit in a third type of supernova was predicted by ken nomoto of the university of tokyo  called an electron-capture supernova it would arise when a star in the transitional range  to solar masses between white dwarf formation and iron core-collapse supernovae and with a degenerate o  ne  mg core  imploded after its core ran out of nuclear fuel causing gravity to compress the electrons in the star core into their atomic nuclei    leading to a supernova explosion and leaving behind a neutron star   in june a paper in the journal nature astronomy reported that the supernova sn in the galaxy ngc  about million light years from earth appeared to be the first observation of an electron-capture supernova    the supernova explosion that created the famous crab nebula in our galaxy had been thought to be the best candidate for an electron-capture supernova and the paper makes it more likely that this was correct   edit failed supernova the core collapse of some massive stars may not result in a visible supernova the main model for this is a sufficiently massive core that the kinetic energy is insufficient to reverse the infall of the outer layers onto a black hole these events are difficult to detect but large surveys have detected possible candidates   the red supergiant - in ngc underwent a modest outburst in march  before fading from view only a faint infrared source remains at the star location  edit a historic puzzle concerned the source of energy that can maintain the optical supernova glow for months although the energy that disrupts each type of supernovae is delivered promptly the light curves are dominated by subsequent radioactive heating of the rapidly expanding ejecta some have considered rotational energy from the central pulsar the ejecta gases would dim quickly without some energy input to keep it hot the intensely radioactive nature of the ejecta gases which is now known to be correct for most supernovae was first calculated on sound nucleosynthesis grounds in the late   it was not until sn that direct observation of gamma-ray lines unambiguously identified the major radioactive nuclei  it is now known by direct observation that much of the light curve the graph of luminosity as a function of time after the occurrence of a type ii supernova  such as sn  is explained by those predicted radioactive decays  although the luminous emission consists of optical photons it is the radioactive power absorbed by the ejected gases that keeps the remnant hot enough to radiate light the radioactive decay of ni through its daughters co to fe produces gamma-ray photons  primarily of and  that are absorbed and dominate the heating and thus the luminosity of the ejecta at intermediate times several weeks to late times several months  energy for the peak of the light curve of was provided by the decay of ni to co half-life days while energy for the later light curve in particular fit very closely with the -day half-life of co decaying to fe later measurements by space gamma-ray telescopes of the small fraction of the co and co gamma rays that escaped the sn remnant without absorption confirmed earlier predictions that those two radioactive nuclei were the power sources  messier the visual light curves of the different supernova types all depend at late times on radioactive heating but they vary in shape and amplitude because of the underlying mechanisms the way that visible radiation is produced the epoch of its observation and the transparency of the ejected material the light curves can be significantly different at other wavelengths for example at ultraviolet wavelengths there is an early extremely luminous peak lasting only a few hours corresponding to the breakout of the shock launched by the initial event but that breakout is hardly detectable optically the light curves for type ia are mostly very uniform with a consistent maximum absolute magnitude and a relatively steep decline in luminosity their optical energy output is driven by radioactive decay of ejected nickel- half-life days which then decays to radioactive cobalt- half-life days these radioisotopes excite the surrounding material to incandescence studies of cosmology today rely on ni radioactivity providing the energy for the optical brightness of supernovae of type ia which are the standard candles of cosmology but whose diagnostic and gamma rays were first detected only in   the initial phases of the light curve decline steeply as the effective size of the photosphere decreases and trapped electromagnetic radiation is depleted the light curve continues to decline in the b band while it may show a small shoulder in the visual at about days but this is only a hint of a secondary maximum that occurs in the infra-red as certain ionised heavy elements recombine to produce infra-red radiation and the ejecta become transparent to it the visual light curve continues to decline at a rate slightly greater than the decay rate of the radioactive cobalt which has the longer half-life and controls the later curve because the ejected material becomes more diffuse and less able to convert the high energy radiation into visual radiation after several months the light curve changes its decline rate again as positron emission becomes dominant from the remaining cobalt- although this portion of the light curve has been little-studied type ib and ic light curves are basically similar to type ia although with a lower average peak luminosity the visual light output is again due to radioactive decay being converted into visual radiation but there is a much lower mass of the created nickel- the peak luminosity varies considerably and there are even occasional type ibc supernovae orders of magnitude more and less luminous than the norm the most luminous type ic supernovae are referred to as hypernovae and tend to have broadened light curves in addition to the increased peak luminosity the source of the extra energy is thought to be relativistic jets driven by the formation of a rotating black hole which also produce gamma-ray bursts  the light curves for type ii supernovae are characterised by a much slower decline than type i on the order of  magnitudes per day  excluding the plateau phase the visual light output is dominated by kinetic energy rather than radioactive decay for several months due primarily to the existence of hydrogen in the ejecta from the atmosphere of the supergiant progenitor star in the initial destruction this hydrogen becomes heated and ionised the majority of type ii supernovae show a prolonged plateau in their light curves as this hydrogen recombines emitting visible light and becoming more transparent this is then followed by a declining light curve driven by radioactive decay although slower than in type i supernovae due to the efficiency of conversion into light by all the hydrogen  in type ii-l the plateau is absent because the progenitor had relatively little hydrogen left in its atmosphere sufficient to appear in the spectrum but insufficient to produce a noticeable plateau in the light output in type iib supernovae the hydrogen atmosphere of the progenitor is so depleted thought to be due to tidal stripping by a companion star that the light curve is closer to a type i supernova and the hydrogen even disappears from the spectrum after several weeks  type iin supernovae are characterised by additional narrow spectral lines produced in a dense shell of circumstellar material their light curves are generally very broad and extended occasionally also extremely luminous and referred to as a superluminous supernova these light curves are produced by the highly efficient conversion of kinetic energy of the ejecta into electromagnetic radiation by interaction with the dense shell of material this only occurs when the material is sufficiently dense and compact indicating that it has been produced by the progenitor star itself only shortly before the supernova occurs large numbers of supernovae have been catalogued and classified to provide distance candles and test models average characteristics vary somewhat with distance and type of host galaxy but can broadly be specified for each supernova type   a absolute magnitude b foe c d notes    order of magnitude  edit pulsar crab nebula  a long-standing puzzle surrounding type ii supernovae is why the remaining compact object receives a large velocity away from the epicentre  pulsars  and thus neutron stars are observed to have high velocities and black holes presumably do as well although they are far harder to observe in isolation the initial impetus can be substantial propelling an object of more than a solar mass at a velocity of s or greater this indicates an expansion asymmetry but the mechanism by which momentum is transferred to the compact object remains update a puzzle proposed explanations for this kick include convection in the collapsing star and jet production during neutron star formation  one possible explanation for this asymmetry is large-scale convection above the core the convection can create variations in the local abundances of elements resulting in uneven nuclear burning during the collapse bounce and resulting expansion  another possible explanation is that accretion of gas onto the central neutron star can create a disk that drives highly directional jets propelling matter at a high velocity out of the star and driving transverse shocks that completely disrupt the star these jets might play a crucial role in the resulting supernova   a similar model is now favored for explaining long gamma-ray bursts  initial asymmetries have also been confirmed in type ia supernovae through observation this result may mean that the initial luminosity of this type of supernova depends on the viewing angle however the expansion becomes more symmetrical with the passage of time early asymmetries are detectable by measuring the polarization of the emitted light  edit although supernovae are primarily known as luminous events the electromagnetic radiation they release is almost a minor side-effect particularly in the case of core collapse supernovae the emitted electromagnetic radiation is a tiny fraction of the total energy released during the event there is a fundamental difference between the balance of energy production in the different types of supernova in type ia white dwarf detonations most of the energy is directed into heavy element synthesis and the kinetic energy of the ejecta in core collapse supernovae the vast majority of the energy is directed into neutrino emission and while some of this apparently powers the observed destruction  of the neutrinos escape the star in the first few minutes following the start of the collapse type ia supernovae derive their energy from a runaway nuclear fusion of a carbon-oxygen white dwarf the details of the energetics are still not fully understood but the end result is the ejection of the entire mass of the original star at high kinetic energy around half a solar mass of that mass is ni generated from silicon burning  ni is radioactive and decays into co by beta plus decay with a half life of six days and gamma rays co itself decays by the beta plus  positron  path with a half life of days into stable fe these two processes are responsible for the electromagnetic radiation from type ia supernovae in combination with the changing transparency of the ejected material they produce the rapidly declining light curve  core collapse supernovae are on average visually fainter than type ia supernovae but the total energy released is far higher in these type of supernovae the gravitational potential energy is converted into kinetic energy that compresses and collapses the core initially producing electron neutrinos from disintegrating nucleons followed by all flavours of thermal neutrinos from the super-heated neutron star core around  of these neutrinos are thought to deposit sufficient energy into the outer layers of the star to drive the resulting catastrophe but again the details cannot be reproduced exactly in current models kinetic energies and nickel yields are somewhat lower than type ia supernovae hence the lower peak visual luminosity of type ii supernovae but energy from the de- ionisation of the many solar masses of remaining hydrogen can contribute to a much slower decline in luminosity and produce the plateau phase seen in the majority of core collapse supernovae foe c       in some core collapse supernovae fallback onto a black hole drives relativistic jets which may produce a brief energetic and directional burst of gamma rays and also transfers substantial further energy into the ejected material this is one scenario for producing high-luminosity supernovae and is thought to be the cause of type ic hypernovae and long-duration gamma-ray bursts  if the relativistic jets are too brief and fail to penetrate the stellar envelope then a low luminosity gamma-ray burst may be produced and the supernova may be sub-luminous when a supernova occurs inside a small dense cloud of circumstellar material it will produce a shock wave that can efficiently convert a high fraction of the kinetic energy into electromagnetic radiation even though the initial energy was entirely normal the resulting supernova will have high luminosity and extended duration since it does not rely on exponential radioactive decay this type of event may cause type iin hypernovae although pair-instability supernovae are core collapse supernovae with spectra and light curves similar to type ii-p the nature after core collapse is more like that of a giant type ia with runaway fusion of carbon oxygen and silicon the total energy released by the highest-mass events is comparable to other core collapse supernovae but neutrino production is thought to be very low hence the kinetic and electromagnetic energy released is very high the cores of these stars are much larger than any white dwarf and the amount of radioactive nickel and other heavy elements ejected from their cores can be orders of magnitude higher with consequently high visual luminosity edit the supernova classification type is closely tied to the type of star at the time of the collapse the occurrence of each type of supernova depends dramatically on the metallicity and hence the age of the host galaxy type ia supernovae are produced from white dwarf stars in binary systems and occur in all galaxy types  core collapse supernovae are only found in galaxies undergoing current or very recent star formation since they result from short-lived massive stars they are most commonly found in type sc spirals  but also in the arms of other spiral galaxies and in irregular galaxies  especially starburst galaxies  type ibc and ii-l and possibly most type iin supernovae are only thought to be produced from stars having near-solar metallicity levels that result in high mass loss from massive stars hence they are less common in older more-distant galaxies the table shows the progenitor for the main types of core collapse supernova and the approximate proportions that have been observed in the local neighbourhood  wolfrayet helium star wolfrayet supergiant supergiant supergiant lbv supergiant blue supergiant there are a number of difficulties reconciling modelled and observed stellar evolution leading up to core collapse supernovae red supergiants are the progenitors for the vast majority of core collapse supernovae and these have been observed but only at relatively low masses and luminosities below about and   respectively most progenitors of type ii supernovae are not detected and must be considerably fainter and presumably less massive it is now proposed that higher mass red supergiants do not explode as supernovae but instead evolve back towards hotter temperatures several progenitors of type iib supernovae have been confirmed and these were k and g supergiants plus one a supergiant  yellow hypergiants or lbvs are proposed progenitors for type iib supernovae and almost all type iib supernovae near enough to observe have shown such progenitors   small magellanic cloud until just a few decades ago hot supergiants were not considered likely to explode but observations have shown otherwise blue supergiants form an unexpectedly high proportion of confirmed supernova progenitors partly due to their high luminosity and easy detection while not a single wolfrayet progenitor has yet been clearly identified   models have had difficulty showing how blue supergiants lose enough mass to reach supernova without progressing to a different evolutionary stage one study has shown a possible route for low-luminosity post-red supergiant luminous blue variables to collapse most likely as a type iin supernova  several examples of hot luminous progenitors of type iin supernovae have been detected sn and sn were both apparently massive luminous stars but are very distant and sn had a highly luminous progenitor likely to have been an lbv  but is a peculiar supernova whose exact nature is disputed  the progenitors of type ibc supernovae are not observed at all and constraints on their possible luminosity are often lower than those of known wc stars  wo stars are extremely rare and visually relatively faint so it is difficult to say whether such progenitors are missing or just yet to be observed very luminous progenitors have not been securely identified despite numerous supernovae being observed near enough that such progenitors would have been clearly imaged  population modelling shows that the observed type ibc supernovae could be reproduced by a mixture of single massive stars and stripped-envelope stars from interacting binary systems  the continued lack of unambiguous detection of progenitors for normal type ib and ic supernovae may be due to most massive stars collapsing directly to a black hole without a supernova outburst  most of these supernovae are then produced from lower-mass low-luminosity helium stars in binary systems a small number would be from rapidly-rotating massive stars likely corresponding to the highly-energetic type ic-bl events that are associated with long-duration gamma-ray bursts   edit edit stellar nucleosynthesis supernova nucleosynthesis supernovae are a major source of elements in the interstellar medium from oxygen through to rubidium    though the theoretical abundances of the elements produced or seen in the spectra varies significantly depending on the various supernova types  type ia supernovae produce mainly silicon and iron-peak elements metals such as nickel and iron   core collapse supernovae eject much smaller quantities of the iron-peak elements than type ia supernovae but larger masses of light alpha elements such as oxygen and neon and elements heavier than zinc the latter is especially true with electron capture supernovae  the bulk of the material ejected by type ii supernovae is hydrogen and helium  the heavy elements are produced by nuclear fusion for nuclei up to s silicon photodisintegration rearrangement and quasiequilibrium during silicon burning for nuclei between ar and ni and rapid capture of neutrons  r-process  during the supernova collapse for elements heavier than iron the r-process produces highly unstable nuclei that are rich in neutrons and that rapidly beta decay into more stable forms in supernovae r-process reactions are responsible for about half of all the isotopes of elements beyond iron  although neutron star mergers may be the main astrophysical source for many of these elements   in the modern universe old asymptotic giant branch agb stars are the dominant source of dust from s-process elements oxides and carbon   however in the early universe before agb stars formed supernovae may have been the main source of dust  edit supernova remnant remnants of many supernovae consist of a compact object and a rapidly expanding shock wave of material this cloud of material sweeps up surrounding interstellar medium during a free expansion phase which can last for up to two centuries the wave then gradually undergoes a period of adiabatic expansion  and will slowly cool and mix with the surrounding interstellar medium over a period of about  years  large magellanic cloud the big bang produced hydrogen  helium  and traces of lithium  while all heavier elements are synthesised in stars and supernovae supernovae tend to enrich the surrounding interstellar medium with elements other than hydrogen and helium which usually astronomers refer to as  metals  these injected elements ultimately enrich the molecular clouds that are the sites of star formation  thus each stellar generation has a slightly different composition going from an almost pure mixture of hydrogen and helium to a more metal-rich composition supernovae are the dominant mechanism for distributing these heavier elements which are formed in a star during its period of nuclear fusion the different abundances of elements in the material that forms a star have important influences on the star life and may decisively influence the possibility of having planets orbiting it the kinetic energy of an expanding supernova remnant can trigger star formation by compressing nearby dense molecular clouds in space  the increase in turbulent pressure can also prevent star formation if the cloud is unable to lose the excess energy  evidence from daughter products of short-lived radioactive isotopes shows that a nearby supernova helped determine the composition of the solar system  years ago and may even have triggered the formation of this system  on june  astronomers reported narrowing down the source of fast radio bursts frbs which may now plausibly include  compact-object mergers and magnetars arising from normal core collapse supernovae   edit supernova remnants are thought to accelerate a large fraction of galactic primary cosmic rays  but direct evidence for cosmic ray production has only been found in a small number of remnants gamma rays from pion -decay have been detected from the supernova remnants ic and  these are produced when accelerated protons from the snr impact on interstellar material  edit supernovae are potentially strong galactic sources of gravitational waves   but none have so far been detected the only gravitational wave events so far detected are from mergers of black holes and neutron stars probable remnants of supernovae  edit near-earth supernova a near-earth supernova is a supernova close enough to the earth to have noticeable effects on its biosphere  depending upon the type and energy of the supernova it could be as far as light-years away in it was theorised that traces of past supernovae might be detectable on earth in the form of metal isotope signatures in rock strata  iron- enrichment was later reported in deep-sea rock of the pacific ocean     in  elevated levels of nitrate ions were found in antarctic ice which coincided with the and supernovae gamma rays from these supernovae could have boosted levels of nitrogen oxides which became trapped in the ice  type ia supernovae are thought to be potentially the most dangerous if they occur close enough to the earth because these supernovae arise from dim common white dwarf stars in binary systems it is likely that a supernova that can affect the earth will occur unpredictably and in a star system that is not well studied the closest known candidate is ik pegasi see below  recent estimates predict that a type ii supernova would have to be closer than eight parsecs  light-years to destroy half of the earth ozone layer and there are no such candidates closer than about light-years  edit list of supernova candidates nebula wolfrayet star light-years  the next supernova in the milky way will likely be detectable even if it occurs on the far side of the galaxy it is likely to be produced by the collapse of an unremarkable red supergiant and it is very probable that it will already have been catalogued in infrared surveys such as  there is a smaller chance that the next core collapse supernova will be produced by a different type of massive star such as a yellow hypergiant luminous blue variable or wolfrayet the chances of the next supernova being a type ia produced by a white dwarf are calculated to be about a third of those for a core collapse supernova again it should be observable wherever it occurs but it is less likely that the progenitor will ever have been observed it isn even known exactly what a type ia progenitor system looks like and it is difficult to detect them beyond a few parsecs the total supernova rate in our galaxy is estimated to be between and per century although we haven actually observed one for several centuries  statistically the next supernova is likely to be produced from an otherwise unremarkable red supergiant but it is difficult to identify which of those supergiants are in the final stages of heavy element fusion in their cores and which have millions of years left the most-massive red supergiants shed their atmospheres and evolve to wolfrayet stars before their cores collapse all wolfrayet stars end their lives from the wolfrayet phase within a million years or so but again it is difficult to identify those that are closest to core collapse one class that is expected to have no more than a few thousand years before exploding are the wo wolfrayet stars which are known to have exhausted their core helium  only eight of them are known and only four of those are in the milky way  a number of close or well known stars have been identified as possible core collapse supernova candidates the red supergiants antares and betelgeuse   the yellow hypergiant rho cassiopeiae   the luminous blue variable eta carinae that has already produced a supernova impostor   and the brightest component a wolfrayet star  in the regor or gamma velorum system  others have gained notoriety as possible although not very likely progenitors for a gamma-ray burst for example wr   identification of candidates for a type ia supernova is much more speculative any binary with an accreting white dwarf might produce a supernova although the exact mechanism and timescale is still debated these systems are faint and difficult to identify but the novae and recurrent novae are such systems that conveniently advertise themselves one example is u scorpii   the nearest known type ia supernova candidate is ik pegasi hr  located at a distance of light-years  but observations suggest it will be several million years before the white dwarf can accrete the critical mass required to become a type ia supernova  edit astronomy portal star portal space portal kilonova super luminous supernovae
